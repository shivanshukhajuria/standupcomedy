happen before the show even begins right im going to give you a very detailed blowbyblow description of exactly how the show is going to unfold now this setting of expectations does go on a bit ive had to cut the actual show in order to fit it in but i believe its worth it you know like to be able to meet your expectations its my job and lets face it this is my difficult second album that is also my tenth and some peoples first you know its a lot of pressure so lets set your expectations when the show begins when the show\\xa0actually begins this is not it dont panic when it begins im gonna kick things off with a bit of observational comedy right a bit of you know have you ever noticed whats up with that that shit thats what im starting with and look its not very good im gonna be perfectly honest with you because im not very observant typically speaking vague as fuck right now fair warning my observations will be about americans which is broadly speaking you lot right so and– and sorry but making fun of americans is still technically punching up although that window is closing um it is and so im just making hay you know cause i cant speak russian so ive really gotta get it in while i can i dont know i should just also warn you during the bit where i make fun of americans your feelings will smart because i will be making fun of you there i just need you to expect that right i will be taking the absolute piss as we say back home not that you care and so youll be sitting there just going oh and fair enough i dont want to deny your feelings have them please let them run through you definitely but what i would suggest strongly is that you do not invest in those feelings dont let them get a grip on you because what this show is if anything is a romantic comedy so its just to that end important that we get off to a shaky start so thats all just dont invest feel but dont invest just go with me trust me dont trust me dont trust that person um anyway that bit right so thats how its gonna start bit of observational comedy then what im going to do is i am going to tell you a story about a curious incident that took place in the dog park in the daytime oh now its a fun story its a fun story and throughout that story i will touch on with consent most of the major themes of the show so watch out for those and it will also include a fair dose of what i call a gentle and very goodnatured needling of the patriarchy so that\\xa0is in there so its very important its very important that you expect that because it is there and if thats not your thing leave ive given you plenty of warning just go off you pop manflakes out you go go on with you now after that story im gonna tell another story what look at me go i know classic the second story is about a misdiagnosis i received and im gonna blame that misdiagnosis squarely on misogyny because its true now after after that thats just the needle if that hurts get out while you can still walk now at the end of that story im going to do a bit of what i call hate baiting its where i bait my haters its a very complex idea now the way that ill do that is i will just say a thing and i will make no fucking effort to make it funny ill just say it and leave it there i dont care now i would strongly recommend that you do not you do not take the bait do not take the bait its not for',\n",
       "  ' you its bad for you youll be all frothy mcfroth face like just leave it there then what im gonna do is im gonna move into the joke section which is jokes right thats why i call it the joke section its just joke after joke its really its classic now if in that bit you find yourself offended by anything i say in the joke section please just remember they are just jokes even if you find yourself surrounded by people who are laughing at something you find objectionable just remember the golden rule of comedy which is if youre in a minority you do not matter you dont dont blame me i didnt write the rules of comedy men did blame them i do its cathartic now there we are the joke section works to really ramp the show up in tone in pace and also in my needling of the patriarchy by that stage the needle will have become a jousting stick uh yep and then with said jousting stick im going to set about tearing my haters a new asshole yep quick as you like brandspanking new and the way that ill do that is by doing exactly what my haters accuse me of doing which is lecturing you so in the middle of the show im giving a big old lecture the twist its funny its fucking funny right which is exactly what my haters accuse me of not being so thats gonna send them on a bit of a loop may kill them fingers crossed now at this stage youre probably wondering and rightly so why would i focus on my haters why would i do that that is\\xa0selfindulgent yes and yes i have read all of taylor swifts work i am aware of the great sage of our age i do understand that haters are just gonna hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate and shes not wrong they are repetitive so why wouldnt i why wouldnt i follow her lead and just shake it off why wouldnt i do that just shake shake shake its one reason that is one reason the other reason is because im not convinced our friend tay tay has been a victim of an actual hate crime and i have so naturally the way that we deal with online hate is going to differ personally i like to snack on it yep nom nom nom this body doesnt just happen i am a real hate patootie now after ive dealt with my haters there sent them on their little fugue spiral what ill do then is change gears dramatically in the show and i will do that by telling you that i have autism and im going to tell you in such a way that its gonna sound like a big reveal but it just it really shouldnt come as a surprise ive just told you and and also because everything in the show up until that point works as a big sequence of red flags that i have autism honestly i have hansel and greteled the fuck out of it it is all there but because ive spoiled my own surprise there in order to make it a big reveal again i have to rely on staging and lighting tricks to bring it in so you go oh its a big reveal so the lights are gonna come in im gonna sit on this stool here and its gonna be right now and– and its not going to work because youre not fucking idiots and then after that bit im gonna do a tiny bit of gear about the antivax movement listen to yourselves listen to yourselves this is youre not unusual right ive toured this show around the world and i can report that no audience anywhere has known how to collectively respond to just the mention of the antivax movement pretty much you just say antivax and people are like ha ha no so thats gonna be fun now my antivax material is different in tone to the rest of the show at the end of it youll sit there and go ooh well she just needed to get that off her chest and its true i do and i will but heres the thing ive never met a joke that i havent wanted to call back ive never met a joke gday ive never meta meta joke thats a pun catch up right now this is a very punheavy show you need to expect a lot of puns and you also need to expect one louis ck joke listen to that he is like the antivax of comedy isnt he now i only have one joke that wasnt it by the way the show hasnt started were still in the prelude the one joke its very good i only need one its a good its a good joke it was a day off pens down have a biscuit the day i wrote that joke fucking good joke i am so solid my louis ck joke its a mic drop moment and i will drop the mic doesnt matter how you respond i will drop the mic except i wont drop the mic because you dont know this yet but you do i have autism and i find loud noises quite distressing so what ill do instead is ill just place the fucker directly on the ground there just pop it down now now that will take away from the theatrics of the moment absolutely but lets not be ableist about this the interesting thing about the louis ck joke is that it happens very late in the show so late you will have forgotten that i told you to expect a louis ck joke which means ive just added an extra layer of mirth to your laugh cake yep because when you laugh at it and you will its very good as youre laughing at it you will remember that i told you to expect a louis ck joke and realize youd forgotten which means youll laugh like this ha ha– oh which means ive just added a third layer because when you realize youll go thats exactly what she said shed do – so youll laugh ha ha– oh hey – laughter its once twice three times a lady can do that you see hey oh in the right hands of course in the right hands and you only need hands who knew most women now after the antivax material what im going to do is im going to try and let you in on my experience of autism and ill do that by telling a story about uh my relationship to a penguin th',\n",
       "  'at may or may not be inside a box uh i cant promise you itll make more sense then either and then ill finish the show out with another lecture what another lecture who knew i did now you do that is what is going on here now i will admit the– the last part of the show there i will be much more likable than i am in the beginning borderline adorable now youre\\xa0probably wondering why wouldnt i start with my best foot forward adorable guns ablazing why wouldnt i do that why would i start off being a bit unlikable because this is a show about autism and people with autism rarely make a good first impression and most people tend to write us off because of that so this is a show that rewards people who persevere who go beyond their discomfort just to see whats on the other side of the spectrum for those people this show does work like a romantic comedy theoretically cause theories are sexy now thats it thats the show thats everything you can expect expectations have been set so the show starts now have you ever noticed how americans are not stupid whats up with that youre not stupid i was so disappointed to discover that because i had been led to believe by you that you are as dumb as bricks and then i meet you all and then youre not i mean youve got your quota as have we all but youre not do you know what you are youre culturally confident good on you i say good on you and you know who else had that skill set the ancient romans and things worked out well for them for a bit dont invest its all right hold true youre all right youre all right america hang in there invest a little now i think its your confidence that makes you stupid bear with me dont invest honestly i do because confidence confidence makes you stupid and im very confident in that opinion because youre so confident in your americaninity that you hang onto things just cause its american and it must be right right you hang onto things just cause its american even if the thing you cling to is proof of literal stupidity and ill give you an example i only need one now we fossil fuel we fossil fuel our cars with the same stuff you do in australia right we fossil fuel it with petroleum now petroleum is very heavy of the syllable we dont have time were busy people we dont have time for syllables lol you know this is where were at so weve wisely shortened petroleum here and there right in australia weve shortened petroleum to petrol now im not bragging thats not like weve just stopped talking that is all that has happened there were just like petrol you have dug a lot deeper into the hat of imagination for your shortening of petroleum because youve shortened it to gas now the interesting thing about petroleum is that it is a liquid and the interesting thing about gas by its very fucking definition is that it is not a liquid but you guys would rather gaslight science or flood it i dont know how the thinking happens in your head but you will not change cause youre like its right cause we thought of it and were americans but its not right it is dumb in the face when i first started touring here i was told i should americanize my language to which i responded fuck off americanise is not spelled with a z  fuckers honestly americans are like the straight white man of cultures you say tomayto thats all you care about like fuck off i will not bow to your confidence i will not say sweater i will be saying jumper and you can cope im not suggesting that jumper makes sense jumper makes fuck all sense but what it does do is it sounds fun im gonna put on a jumper oh mate youre gonna have a good day off you pop but you guys you put on a sweater yeah this is the top i wear to soak up\\xa0the wet of my body mmm biscuit biscuit deal with it i call someone a dick biscuit later in the show and when i say cause im mature and when i say biscuit i mean what you call a cookie and not what you call a biscuit which is what i call a rogue scone that is a scone what forgot its manners it is out of control but i will not say dick cookie i will not i refuse cause it doesnt work when you call someone a dick biscuit it means we dont want to like them and dick biscuit does that it sounds like theyre in slytherin dick biscuit dick cookie yeah its all right its like\\xa0ravenclaw no one really knows whats up with them but they seem all right they seem fine and ive decided that dr cock biscotti hufflepuff that is definitely hufflepuff dr cock biscotti and ive put no thought into gryffindor whatsoever cause fuck em they are like the straight white man of hogwarts what about hermione shes probably a terf fuck her punching up i mean i have made some concessions for you im not a monster like ill say waldo wheres waldo ive always known him as wally but look its not that hard waldo did it so the trick is there if you find waldo youve found wally its the same guy and ive happily taken on a lot of your wordage theres a lot about your language i like america like arugula yes please we call that stuff rocket fuck off rocket i want arugula it sounds like a clown car horn yes please arugula and aluminum mmhmm yes we have the same word but we say aluminium why would you say aluminium when you can flirt it aluminum stop it america and yall oh yes please thanks all yall for yall im taking yall i love yall because yall is the best most inclusive secondperson plural pronoun in the englishspeaking world thank you the south what an ally im in two minds about fanny just the word cause here fanny is your butt your rear end your backside your bu',\n",
       "  'm in australia fanny refers specifically to the lady front bum to use inclusive language i dont know and when i first heard that everyone in america has a fanny i thought cool cool cool cool im going to the isle of lesbos giddy up thats just a joke it doesnt belong there must have snuck out of the joke section apologies there no ive known about the fanny discrepancy for a very long time i will never forget the day i discovered fanny meant a different thing here than it does back home i was at school i was reading a book it was an american book untranslated ive always had a bit of a gift for the languages now it was just a random childrens book about four kids on an adventure and part of their adventure apparently these four children slid down a hill on their fannies and i lost an afternoon i lost an afternoon trying to make that work in my minds eye because that is not how you go down a hill if you go down a hill like that that is not a decision youve tripped and what are the chances of four children synchronizedtripping and it not rating a mention from the narrator fuck all so why would you choose to go down like that its not aerodynamic and i dont care how you identify that is vulnerable and which way do you go head first feet first well neither are aerodynamic and what the fuck do you do with your knees i should probably tell you what douglas means cause it means a very different thing here than it does back home in australia a douglas is slang for a kangaroos uterus its fucking not like why would we have slang for that for fucks sake australians are not even that australian come on it was just my dogs name ive named this show after my dog his names douglas um its weird that thats the thing you clap but cool well done you named your dog and then your show after the same youre not so weird anymore um douglas is my first dog douglas is my first dog as an adult i had lots of\\xa0dogs when i was growing up our family went through them a bit we lived on a busy road – um – oh all right thats where youre at look it just really paints a picture of a time and a place look douglas is fine i dont live on a busy road anymore i take good care of the boy i take him to the dog park and anyone who goes to a dog park on the regular knows that no good conversation is ever had at a dog park they are just festivals of small talk and that is not my natural habitat you dont know why yet but you do now i want to tell you a story about a terrible conversation i had at the dog park once this bloke just walks up to me i mean he had a dog he wasnt just being creepy he had context i want to tell you this its not pertinent to the story but i want you to know his dog had shoes on and his dog did not want to have shoes on he was doing that like and it was a whippet situation and theyre\\xa0shaky at the best of times we dont know why are they cold are they nervous but it was like just it was a lot now its not important to the story but it was a lot in my periphery so i just want you to know added stress now this was my uh friends icebreaker wed never met this was his icebreaker he said did you know it takes less muscles to smile than frown the men in the audience are sitting there going oh youve experienced an isolated incident and the women are sitting there going oh for fucks sake and nonbinary folk are like is that a hard day for you is it now as far as icebreakers go its a fucking shit one basically what hes saying is your face is wrong can you change it like honestly and even if i gave him the benefit of the doubt right and truly believed that energy consumption was his chief concern that he was just looking at me going if only she knew she could live her best life she could get so much more out of her day if only she knew like even if i believed that the thing is i was neither smiling nor frowning my face was neutral which takes fuck all muscles now i am aware that my neutral face is not particularly chipper like i do look like someone stabbed a potato with a spoon upside down honestly like no muscles neutral now i have resting bitch face thats what its called thats what its colloquially known as resting bitch face only women have resting bitch face men simply have very important thoughts youd best not interrupt them having honestly no one has ever gone up to a man while hes a stranger and gone cheer up love it may never happen no as far as icebreakers go that was a bit shit do you know how i responded i started frowning i started using muscles id had no intention of using just moments earlier but he thought it went very well so he stepped the conversation up another notch and he said what is your dogs name classic and i responded by saying doug cause hes only douglas when hes in trouble i discovered now when i said doug this mans response was a little much hes basically i said doug and hes gone good one and i said its not i dont know why i think i was still in frown land ive just gone its not a good name and he said it is so i said its not so lets just this is whats happening im having an argument with a stranger in the dog park about whether or not my dogs name is good and im not on the side youd assume id be on and his dog had shoes on we had more important things to talk about instead were going its a bad name its a good name eventually hes like look its a good name because doug dogs dig doug now it was a singularly humiliating moment as a professional comedian to have my own joke that i hadnt even thought of explained back to me as if i had thought of ',\n",
       "  'it but just forgot like i didnt notice id had doug for over a year hadnt fucking clocked that his name was a pun humiliated so i did what any reasonable mature person would do i lied i said no ive– his names douglas and i named him after the pouch of douglas i will have you know and he said what is the pouch of douglas and its a fair question because the pouch of douglas is an obscure situation so i explained i said the pouch of douglas is a bit of potential space that exists and its situated between the anal cavity and the uterus in the female biological sex reproductive environment at the dog park and this guy did not blink hes just frozen and he started frowning and he was suddenly working very hard and i took that look of fear mingled with vague repulsion and mistook it for genuine curiosity and i thought this man wants to know more so i explained its neither front nor back its right in the middle its in fanny\\xa0neutral territory well call it fanny switzerland and it doesnt have its own entrance i said as if that made it all better like you cant you cant just get to it although if you were to stick your thumb up the bum and your finger up the relevant vagine and clap that bit in there thats your pouch of douglas in there at the dog park cause its not an actual thing its just its a crawl space for emergencies the best the best way i can explain it is this youve got a suitcase and you want to open the suitcase you take the zip all the way around the suitcase but when you go to open the suitcase it does not open because you have not used the zip zip youve used the funny zip which does go all the way around the suitcase but it doesnt fucking open it just mocks you so when you go to open the suitcase it just does that and now you have not opened the suitcase but what youve done is youve created a bit of extra space in there and you cant see it and you cant access it but you know its there that is the pouch of douglas thank you im delighted im delighted you enjoyed my explanation of the pouch of douglas because my friend at the dog park did not i just still cant get over that theres something inside of me in a very particular part of my body called the pouch of douglas its fucking weird borderline not okay but it is also a reminder that we do live in a world where everything has been named by men everything everything and that was named after a man dr james douglas who was an  century scottish man midwife what an uncomfortable collection of demographics that is like do not headline your linkedin with that that is a mistake it was named after dr james douglas because apparently he found it first what a day what a day he must have been having just rummaging around a lady cadaver rummage rummage hobbies were different then he must have just found her funny zip and then saw it sitting there all void no name at which point dr james douglas must have thought well this is it this is my shot at legacy honestly it just never ceases to amaze me how little men have to do in order to be remembered he found a not thing and called dibs we would live in a very different world if women had participated in the naming of things like do you fellows honestly believe youd have balls if women had been at that meeting no cause heres the thing women dont think of your testicles as a sport or a game you like to play with them that is your bag and your bag alone cool story but how would you like it if wed have given you karens handful how the fuck would you like that just having an olde woman with a grip around your tenderloins all fucking day how would you like that im so sorry im clearly not an expert what is this i am sorry i think in my minds eye karen is a marionette just what do balls i had to see a doctor uh this is a while ago um cause i had some issues with my douglas environment very broadly speaking um and my regular doctor was away so i was seeing her replacement uh now the replacement doctor was not a doctor i would ever have chosen for myself we werent a good match we didnt get along from the getgo he was a fucking arrogant asshole i mean he was a qualified doctor as well yes absolutely but that is a venn diagram with a lot of crossover were going to call him dr dick biscuit okay there it is now dr dick biscuit decided after running no tests that the solution to my douglas malaise was that i should go on the pill the pill theres more proof men have named all the things the pill thats a bit fucking vague isnt it most things you prescribe doctor could be called a pill hes like yes but this is the pill the pill it sounds like theres just a giant pill in the town square we all scurry out and nibble on mmm its monday what does it do witchcraft shut up call it a pill i said to dr dick biscuit look i dont want to take the pill ive been on the pill before and the pill tends to give me suicidal ideation you thought i was all out of trauma now dr dick biscuit didnt enjoy me bringing that to the table the table being a consultation about my body hes like no no thank you very much and do you know what he did he shushed me he said you will do well to listen to me it was our first fight and i did what i always do in a bit of conflict i made a joke this was my joke i said instead of going on the pill how about i have a hysterectomy yep you get it i dont know why he didnt get it as far as jokes go thats a classic i cant think of a context where that wouldnt be a joke like on what planet would i have control over my own body not this one so clearly its a joke',\n",
       "  ' and also it should have been clear because i used jokey words i didnt use formal terminology i did not say hysterectomy what i said was why dont we just whip out the whole kit and caboodle then if that wasnt clear enough i was joking i followed it up with besides ive heard decluttering is in fashion doctor and this does not spark joy thank you im delighted im delighted you enjoyed that joke because dr dick biscuit did not he did not get my joke and so i did not get his humanity and things just escalated from there and he just began shouting at me right and when he just fully laid into me at which point i began to cry and then dr dick biscuit took my distress as proof his diagnosis was correct clearly i was hormonal classic copout dick biscuit fuck me men calling women hormonal pretty much its the number one hobby of mankind of all time like a man is allowed to call a woman hormonal just whenever a woman says or does something a man failed to predict thats it its like i wasnt expecting that so clearly youre just a clusterfuck of internalized chaos you make up to be a bitch like men call women hormonal as if men dont have hormones thats the bit that shits me because newsflash fellas youve got hormones and sometimes you get testy yeah you do sometimes karen gives it a bit of a squeeze and you get upset and fair enough youre only human happens to the best of us look ive been known to want to nibble a bit of\\xa0dark chocolate on a full moon i dont know witchcraft but ive never had to punch a door so we all have our things fellas like honestly what do you think boys will be boys means if men are so good at neutralizing their hormones like its not the convenient alibi for sexual assault that so many people are so desperate for it to mean know what boys will be boys means it means we are not preparing our boys for the real world it means we know we know that boys are at the mercy of their hormones were just culturally incapable of holding them accountable for their actions so we hold women accountable stop it its bait you fucking idiots its bait leave it its not for you its not a rally fuck every time i do that i feel like ive got to walk around the bait look i dont need my hormones to be unreasonable i would just love men to know that like i dont need i can just be unreasonable cause i dont wanna i have plenty of what i call puffer fish moments right you know puffer fish those fish that get startled and go oh this is a solution its not thats what happens i get filled with this impotent fury and i cant do anything about whatever it is im angry about because im just like if you eat me ill fuck you up but otherwise im just over here and its only little things thatll set the puffer fish off little things not the big picture little things like the paleo diet dont even look sideways at me with that shit because my response is out of control its disproportionate someone will just innocently say im on the paleo and ill go are you first of all i dont care two your breath stinks eat some fucking fiber for fucks sake three we dont know what they ate we have no clue what paleolithic humans actually ate but we are dead certain they didnt eat cauliflower popcorn you prick and you see it doesnt matter where on my cycle i am same rage wheres waldo is another one fuck him because why is waldo why why why have we wasted so many hours out of the lives of generations of children looking for that prick because you look and look and looking is\\xa0an investment youre caring and then you start to worry i hope hes okay and then you find him and nothing is ever the matter ever hes only ever on holiday having quite a nice time of it fuck you waldo he should have to find himself like the rest of us have to honestly if you want to see a childrens book illustration of white male privilege it is that guy because here is a man who makes no effort no effort to help himself yet fully expects everybody on earth to give a shit about his whereabouts at all times just change your ugly fucking jumper mate to be honest that one does fluctuate depending on the moon and the tides but ultimately what a waste of my emotional resources i also waste them on the teenage mutant ninja turtles big issue its donatello ill tell you why now if you didnt know the teenage mutant ninja turtles are a street gang and weirdly that is not my issue its a comic book television film franchise and the target demographic for it is pretty much young boys now the teenage mutant ninja turtles have names they are michelangelo leonardo raphael and donatello they are named after renaissance artists because nothing says frescoes like nunchucks am i right im not right now the interesting thing about the renaissance what we popularly understand as the renaissance is the italian high renaissance and that was a very short art movement twenty years over it went from  to  done now michelangelo leonardo raphael all at the height of their artistic prowess during those  years donatello oh no oh no no no no he was dead dead by  he does not belong in their street gang hes dead do you know who belongs in that street gang titian by rights it should be titian do you know why titian do you know why titian is not in that street gang because the target demographic of that television show could not handle a name that begins with tit because of their fucking hormones we are not preparing our boys for the real world or history which they wrote weird and theyre tortoises they are not turtles they are tortoises tortoises are the c',\n",
       "  'lomp clomps turtles are the flip flips now i understand i understand that theyre mutants i get it but they are using nunchucks this means they need to have some terrestrial dexterity experience and this is not enough we are not preparing our boys for the real world what if they went to the galapagos fucked my most recent puffer fish was during a conversation with this bloke who was trying to tell me that golf is not a sport because it doesnt put stress on your cardiovascular system isnt that not interesting doesnt matter how you spin it dull and it gets worse because he kept talking he said if youre participating in something and it doesnt put stress on your cardiovascular system youre not\\xa0participating in a sport youre merely playing a game and that conversation made me so fucking angry it felt like a sport now i hope nobodys in here just going finally oh someone here to defend golfs honor that is not whats happening here in fact i hope golf is sad i hope golf is all sooky la la cause i fucking hate golf with all the reasonable rage i can muster what a monumental waste of land time and water for fucks sake honestly men who have families and play golf are cunts you dont have time fellas youve got a family not a spare six hours to just waltz around a park with your mates while your womenfolk do unpaid labor grow up theres more proof men have named all the things whats the worst thing you can call someone cunt its a reference to female genitalia and i wont have it when i use the cword i mean it i mean it to be the worst thing you can call someone but i dont associate it with my own biology or anybodys biology do you know what i see in my minds eye when i use the cword a literal golfer just a rich white chump in chinos and one glove what a cunt honestly it cannot be a coincidence that theyre called cuntry clubs come on ill tell you what my my last show nanette gave a lot of people the puffer fish like pfff you know youve made it and i say\\xa0people but it was only men hashtag not all men okay of course its not all men its never been all men generally speaking its really only the men who use that hashtag theyre the ones you know men pronounced me you know theyre the ones who go out of their way to let me know that nanette was not comedy because it didnt make me laugh every step of the way first of all good if that show made you laugh all the way through what the fuck is wrong with you secondly yes i turned the laugh tap off myself it was a decision i stand by it its not like i got halfway through and thought fuck im out of jokes ill tell a sad story i hope anyone wont notice i know better than anyone that what i did with nanette was not technically comedy but im also not a fucking idiot i wanted that show to have an audience and a broad audience and if that meant i had to trick people by calling it comedy thats technically a joke but i have to say i have to say a bad joke made so many men so viscerally angry im surprised nobody accused me of writing a sport honestly it look first of all it doesnt bother me right this doesnt bother me look look ive still got the loud stick i dont feel threatened in fact ii like the hate death threats aside its fun nom nom nom right but the thing is whenever i have a puffer fish i always work under the assumption – that the problem is mostly me right – if im like it just doesnt seem like a good place to start a dialog i have never written a letter to donatello or waldo like no point ones dead and ones never home but still i just wouldnt occur to me but to this day i still get men sliding into my dms to let me know in all caps that theyve\\xa0never heard of me its a riddle how do they know look i cant experience the humiliation i know theyre so desperate for me to feel because i cant help but feel worried for them because thats a tough life if new things are so painful ow they thats a learning difficulty imagine school for someone like that long division ive never fucking heard of it i got accused of doing all sorts of nefarious things in lieu of comedy i really did like a monologue what a monster if true a glorified ted talk uhoh a onewoman show a lecture a fucking lecture can you believe that one the cheek of that one a lecture nanette was not a fucking lecture it wasnt a monologue either it wasnt like i was sitting on a stool like a stunned mullet in a spotlight it wasnt a fucking monologue and a glorified ted talk why do they need glorifying they are fine and a onewoman show no shit sherlock and it wasnt a fucking lecture you want a lecture ill give you a fucking lecture this is a lecture now there is some debate as to when the high renaissance actually began some put it at  while others argue it began in  either way donatello was fucking dead back in the  century karen had very very cold hands give them a rub kaz come on now this is raphaels school of athens this is where raphael has so kindly painted all the men who named all of the things now strictly speaking these are not raphaels contemporaries although he has used their likeness but basically these are the ancient greeks and by the time raphael painted this all the greeks were dead not all the greeks i am so sorry there are still a lot of greeks alive and thriving in the world today hello and welcome no just the ancient greeks they are all dead they lived on a busy road it was built by the ancient romans now who have we got here weve got pythagoras hes busy naming all the triangles thats acute one youve got socrates here he took a bit of a tumble',\n",
       "  ' classic socrates good with the thoughts shit with the walk get up mate arugula now what were the women doing while all the men were doing the very important naming of all the things from my research what i gather women were generally standing around in groups of three naked just waiting for men to name all of the things you can see it happening with this central figure shes saying what have you got in your hand there karen oh just a couple of bits and bobs women were just holding things just waiting hoping it wasnt poisonous waiting for men to name the things this was painted before beds were named you can see women desperately trying to make the beds just flinging the linen into the trees willynilly just going oh i dont know mm lets just build a fort well make it a fancy fort yay we finished the fort dancing naked in groups of three in the forest is the number one hobby of women of all time and dont we just love it isnt that the safest thing youve ever heard of oh we love it now this might just look like a footloose fancyfree frolic in the forest on a bank holiday no drama but let me draw your attention to this group here that is too tight for fun times alone it suggests tension what has happened has someone mentioned the paleo no what has happened is this central figure here has realized that this bit of cloth this waft of gauze this potential fort if you will has made its way so far up her clacker so far up her clacker it has both fannies covered and she is upset now its worth pointing out at this juncture that this is not a photograph this is not an accidental photograph taken of an unfortunate moment awkward no what this is is a painting which makes this a decision its a decision that a man made and spent time on ah i have autism its a tiny monologue i was very late diagnosed only four years ago diagnosed four years ago but ii selfdiagnosed first which is a great way to approach any specialist ooh they love it oh they say tell me more about what you think um but the only reason i even thought to selfdiagnose was because people kept telling me it was usually after a show people would just come up to me and say i think you have autism to be fair to every single person thats ever done that to me in my life i think they were all on the spectrum because thats how we roll pretty much its like i have a piece of information you seem to be missing you may or may not be ready to hear this information but ill tell you because knowledge is power ignorance is a cage and feelings can be dealt with i bid you good day my issue was i didnt understand enough about autism to understand how i could have autism because what we popularly understand autism to be is just something that only affects young boys that like maths a lot and to this day neither of those things apply to me so people would tell me i think you have autism im like i dont understand how you got that i mean sure ive been vaccinated but other than that oh hey oh here it is oh strap yourselves in of all the toxic myths about autism thats got to be right up the top not least because we know that vaccinations do not cause autism do you know what causes autism no you fucking dont and if if you honestly think you do your confidence is making you stupid now i also know that theres nothing i can say that can change an antivaxxers mind i know that because thats not how closed minds work they dont work theyre closed for business right so like to open a closed mind it has to be an inside job so i know theres nothing i can do thatll change an antivaxxers mind im gonna have a go anyway gonna have a go because my theory is by accusing them of having a closed mind theyll be reactive and go no i dont and ill get in and there will be antivaxxers in this room absolutely do not identify yourselves do not that is not whats happening here you are outnumbered and i know you like to willfully manipulate statistics but this is even beyond you and also and there will be antivaxxers in this room make no mistake because my core demographic is rich white entitled women and that is a venn diagram with a lot of crossover but if you are an antivaxxer i can guarantee you you will not like this next bit but if youve been laughing the whole way through the show and you suddenly stop now everyone will know so if thats not what you want to happen just do a bit of this you will not be enjoying it just do a bit of that all right antivaxxers lets pretend youre right youre not pretending is not science but lets lets im– lets pretend youre right that vaccinations cause autism they dont now what because as somebody who exists on the autism spectrum let me say this to you im happy to take one for the team and im not suggesting that autism is easy it isnt it is difficult and i will not and cannot deny that but as difficult as this life is its nice to have a life and its particularly nice to have that life in a world without polio polio is bad and that is a fact not a feeling and i would much prefer to have autism than be a sociopath like you let me explain cause if you honestly think that your child your only single child is more important than all the other children collectively youre not playing for the team and if you dont want to play for the team why the fuck are you even having children get a pet rock and delete your fucking blog got that off my chest now i do know that once this is streaming that little bit is opening me up to a whole world of a hate campaign from the antivax movement because make no mistake t',\n",
       "  'hey are coordinated they are not random they are a cult and ive only been ive only been telling this material one room at a time and the hate is already trickling in and it is targeted and it is venomous but it doesnt bother me dont worry about it like i snack on it mmm nom nom nom its really its fine you have worked out why i do that yeah why i snack on hate youve worked it out its how you build up immunity its called microdosing yeah your hate is my vaccine what are you gonna do ive already got autism i have whats called highfunctioning autism which is a terrible name for what i have because it gives the impression that i function highly i do not to give you an idea of what it feels like to be on the spectrum basically it feels like being the only sober person in a room full of drunks or the other way around basically everyone is operating on a wavelength you cant quite key into to give you a visual this woman is on the spectrum that is the story of my fucking life honestly oh it was a funeral same place same time last week why didnt i get the memo why are they kissing i dont like the sound i never get the memo i never do ive always missed the memo i remember going from being the teachers pet to bring the teachers nemesis in one lesson and until i was diagnosed i never understood what had happened the lesson was on prepositions so strap yourselves in for this story now i do like my teacher she was a good teacher i liked the way she explained things but we lost each other this way this is how she began the lesson she said imagine a box and i could do that i was gifted to a point visual thinker good box solid threedimensional nothing fancy but there and then she said a preposition is a word that explains your relationship to the box and thats when my thinking just fell apart because i thought im related to a box then she said now you can be behind the box does anybody know what the preposition is there no they didnt but i had a question i said am i made of box now let me bring you into my thinking there i thought if i was related to a box we must share dna and it made more sense in my head that i would be made of box than the box would be made of me but my teacher was not privy to that gifted train of thought circling my head there so she was a bit thrown and she said no hannah youre not made of box im surprised you had to ask that so okay you can be in front of the box then does anybody know what the preposition is there no they didnt but i had another question i said does the box have a name i thought if i had a name i could work out how we were related maybe we were cousins and she said no its a box boxes dont have names hannah what boxes do you know have names and i started listing breakfast cereals shes like all right okay you can be beside the box does anybody know what the preposition is there no they\\xa0didnt but i had another question i dont remember my thinking behind this question but i remember asking it because when i did everybody laughed and i had no idea why but i remembered really liking the feeling uhoh this was the question i said am i allowed to eat the box of course yes everybody is laughing except me and the teacher looking back i dont know why the fuck she wasnt laughing as far as jokes go thats a classic a baby dyke just asked if she was allowed to eat the box she didnt think it was funny she was like okay all right okay calm down okay we might be on the wrong track how about we imagine something else in relation to the box then okay how about a penguin now the penguin can be inside the box does anybody know what the preposition is there no they didnt but i had some fucking questions about the penguin i said what is the penguin made of and that was the question that broke my teacher you know youve broken a teacher when a teacher who never swears swears bad so i went whats the penguin made of and shes like penguin i mean its made of fucking penguin and as far as answers go thats mwah like that is watertight that is a stunning answer you cant logic out of that answer that is a good answer at that point i thought i might be on the wrong track but i\\xa0had other questions pressing but i thought now doesnt seem the time she seems upset so what i thought is i might hang on to my question thats what i thought and that was my mistake i should have asked my question then while we were in the thick of it or not at all because i did the worst possible thing i waited until she felt safe then i asked my question but i waited so long it wasnt even the same lesson it was much later in the day in silent reading i waited so long it wasnt even a question anymore it was more of a theory and that made it worse i said what if the penguin ate the box wouldnt then you say the penguins a little bit made of box shes like get out and that was the first but not the last time i was sent out for reasons i had no idea why because the thing is i was genuinely engaged in that lesson like i really– i really wanted to know what a preposition was i wasnt sitting there going prepositions ive never fucking heard of them but as she explained to me later she said you were being deliberately obtuse im like but im not a triangle i did not learn what a preposition was that day look i understand what they are now im all over it and i also understand if the penguin ate\\xa0the box the penguin would be around the box honestly the day i was formally diagnosed with autism was a very good day because it felt like id been handed the keys to the city of me becau',\n",
       "  'se i was able to make sense of so many things that had only ever been confusing to me like why i could be so intelligent but struggle to leave any proof why i cant fill in forms why wh– why i felt such a profound sense of isolation my entire life despite trying so hard to be part of the team and that is a big thing about being on the spectrum it is lonely i find it very difficult to connect to others because my\\xa0brain takes me to places where nobody else lives and you cant just start talking to people about the pouch of douglas at the dog park people do not like it and i tried more than once but im not here to collect your pity im here to disrupt your confidence because clearly ive worked out a way to share my thinking havent i like you can call this whatever the fuck you need to call this a monologue a lecture you say tomato i say ketchup busy road let me dumb it down for you what this show is is a metaphorical preposition that explains the relationship between what you think you think you see me think and what im genuinely able to think because i like the way that i think if the world is right and im right in it i can find my funny zip and my thinking expands there is beauty in the way that i think i dont think outside the box but as it turns out if i ask nicely yes i am allowed to eat the box oh look sponsored by mcdonalds can you see him\\xa0can you see him what a cunt now this is saint bernard thats saint bernard thats the virgin mary thats the baby jc and that is a tiny lion now can you see the main action thats going on in this picture can you see whats happening the virgin mary is lactating on his fucking face gday now this guys going you know look im– im usually the weirdest thing in a picture im a tiny lion but hes not though because the virgin mary is lactating on his fucking face now this picture tells the story of how bernard became saint bernard one day he was regular old bernard and then he had a vision and in that vision the virgin mary appeared to him and lactated on his fucking face now im not judging the bloke weve all had the dreams weve all had them where we wake up and go i did not know that about myself its fine whats weird though is he did not wake up and go i might file that under secret no thats not what he did he woke up and said id better tell the fellas and then the fellas have a meeting and go this is amazing wed better call this one a saint hes a saint now cause what sorry what hes a saint cause what he had a wet dream and now hes a fucking saint he witnessed the miracle of lactation and now hes a saint he made it about himself and now hes a fuck this is a low bar this is proof men have named all the things and rigged the fucking game this is not enough lets talk about a meritocracy now this is saint cecilia she had to learn the fucking cello what did bernie do ahh it is not enough isnt it weird that the cello has been invented but not the music stand why are they still relying on small naked babies this is my favorite painting this is the duchess of alba by the great spanish artist goya i love it because she would have paid a pretty penny for this portrait and she paid that pretty penny just so she could tell people for centuries to come that shes got shoes on ive got shoes on ive got shoes on yall i got shoes on that is what i imagine the whippet was saying in the dog park i got shoes on women getting stuck to rocks is the number two hobby of ladies of all time all time this is under this ones made of rock they are just getting stuck look what is happening here like just like what that is a salty salty body of water like shes not swimming shes just skating across the surface on her fanny what do you do with your knees cats had a stroke this guy went thank god youre in

out i bought a mirror put it on my ceiling for no reason at all it was a tuesday true story you dont do no shit like that on a tuesday thats a weekend move not a tuesday move it was all good until i caught a reflection of myself in that mirror when we were fucking let me tell you something people whatever you think you look like when you fucking i promise you you dont look like that i promise you im not talking about you posing in front of the mirror im talking about an unexpected glimpse of yourself in the goddamn mirror i saw the bottom of my feet i have never been more disgusted with myself as a man until i saw the bottom of my goddamn feet my feet were black as shit where was i at i didnt wear shoes today jesus christ i wouldnt fuck nobody with feet like this its disgusting my back was ashy i had bumps on my ass when did my ass break out like this had a full batch of measles on my ass and didnt know it i immediately booked a doctors appointment yall gotta fix this i got braille on my butt this is disgusting whenever you go through any insecurities especially when it comes to sex as a man we all turn to the same place for answers every man in this room has turned to porn at some point in time stupidest shit that a man can do heres why i say its stupid we dont give people that do porn enough credit and enough respect those people are professional actors and actresses thats what they do for a living you cant just watch that shit and go home and try it it dont work like that thats like watching a karate movie going outside getting in a fight telling everybody to back up so you can roundhouse kick this n i g g a in the head you dont know how to do that kick its the same thing with porn im not speaking from a hypothetical place ive been there ive done it ive tried it i watched porn with my wife tried to do the shit that i saw i was nervous about it i was having a conversation with myself should i do it should i fucking do it should i try it i had good kevin on this side bad kevin was on this side good kevin popped up good kevin had on a pair of khakis and a vneck sweater he said absolutely not dont do it thats a good woman you talk to her first bad kevin popped up bad kevin had on a pair of leather pants and a fishnet tank top he was doing this bad kevin bad kevin said you going to listen to a man with khakis on no no he said do it then do it out of nowhere i spit on my wife puh it was quick right in the fucking forehead puh a loogie right on her goddamn forehead  there was an awkward beat of silence nobody said nothing it was quiet out of nowhere she was like you just fucking spit on me the complete opposite reaction from the lady in the porn the lady in the porn went crazy when it happened she was like  ooooh ooooh this spit making me so hot oh this spit gonna make me cum oh in my mind i was like thats how you make them cum you gotta spit on their fucking heads ive been doing it wrong all this time i ',\n",
       "  'even told my wife youre not doing it right you got to rub it in thats how you fucking cum i had to go downstairs get a baby wipe clean her head off that was embarrassing i go to get back in the bed she want to talk about it what did i tell you guys i dont like to talk let it float in the air and disappear i dont want to talk about it as soon as i get in the bed she was like did you really just spit on me i almost lied i almost lied even though i know that she know that i know i did it i almost fucking lied the reason why is because bad kevin popped back up bad kevin was like say it was a leak in the ceiling i said now get the hell out of here bad kevin yes yes i spit on you why i dont know i was watching porn i saw some shit i tried it she said kevin let me tell you something i dont care if you watch porn dont be stupid enough to bring the shit you saw in our house she said i watch porn all the time i dont try to do the shit that i saw to you i said er back the fuck up when did this become a  whorehouse the hell you mean you watching porn what the hell are you watching shes like everything  argh instantly it got hurt the reason why it hurt me is because i fucking couldnt separate my pride from reality this is a problem that all men have see reality is if she wants to watch porn she can if i want to watch porn i can thats how it should be but my pride my pride wont let it be that way my pride wanted to know what she was watching i want to see it let me see it with my eyes i want to see it she said you want to see it let me see it she got her laptop opened it up she said my porn search is in my cookies all you got to do is search my cookies i said you better get me a glass of milk cause im about to eat all these goddamn cookies the shit that i saw hurt my heart it hurt me the reason why is because her porn search was the complete opposite of who i am everything i saw was big everything was big big balls to the walls big bats on big blacks big cocks and socks what the fuck is going on one of the sites wasnt even porn it was a bunch of tall men being active they were changing light bulbs putting shit on shelves hanging paintings what kind of sick

claw on it so you can grab stuff i went and bought one i didnt tell her i just put it under my bed waited for the next time we were having sex i was like yo you know this picture by the bed is crooked

my marriage is what im trying to tell you all man its important to understand that you go through levels in life theres tons of levels man as you go through these levels fucking just understand what they were and become better im gonna give you guys one gem if you take nothing from this show tonight take this one piece of information with you so many people are on this journey to live a perfect life i personally think its stupid the reason why i say its stupid is because you have no idea what perfection is unless youve experienced imperfection the point that im making is that you should embrace your flaws and fuckups because they help make you who youre supposed to be dont run away from your bullshit embrace it and become better – thats my message –  now right now right now were actually at a new stage we just had a baby nine months ago kenzo kash hart man thank you father of three father of three now now heres the thing people thought i was playing around when i first talked about it but i wasnt i didnt know if i really wanted to have another baby i felt like i did it i got the best of both worlds i got a boy i got to girl were married my kids are your kids you got kids those are your kids she was like i know but theyre old i want new ones first of all listen to me dont talk about my fucking kids like theyre used cars aint nothing wrong with these goddamn kids shes like i know i just want new ones the thing is i didnt know if i had the patience to deal with kids that two year old age you need patience to deal with a twoyearold baby all you do is repeat yourself all goddamn day to a twoyearold child you say the same shit over and over again hey hey come here look at me hey look at me what did i say no come here look at me hey look at me what did i no come

man with a twoyearold baby it was sad he was treating the baby like a loose basketball at the playground hey hey grab that baby hey goddamn ah fucking back goddam',\n",
       "  'n somebody grab that baby throw that baby back but he was a cool old head you know those old head that are stuck in that era in this era right here he was cool as shit he did not know how to work none of the baby shit so he was trying to get my attention he was like hey hey youngblood hey youngblood let me holler at you real quick hey youngblood  stay it  youngblood let me holler at

i made a left and my baby slid from the right and smacked her head on the glass on the left hand side she was bleeding and everything ill tell her mother it happened at the playground but between us it did not give me some come on now hello you know what im talking about ladies i will say this though when it comes to having patience you got it i take my hat off to you you actually deserve all the accolades that come your way when it comes to dealing with a child ladies feeding your kid bathing your kid clothing your kid to school from school potty training some of you do it while you work its unfuckingbelievable unbelievable but but the one thing that you are not ladies is fun youre not fun i know some women instantly got an attitude what bullshit im fucking fun you dont even know im so much fun no youre not youre not youve never heard a kid say i cant wait to get home and play with my mom you aint never heard that its never happened the reason why is because you try to blur the lines ladies you want to do it all you want to be the fun parent and the disciplinarian you cant be both you gotta pick one see the fun tag gets slapped on the dads back we dont ask for it its just the way it is we dont want to be the disciplinarian either but you make us become the disciplinarian as soon as a man walks in the house you hit him with the bullshit go in there and go fuck that baby up what what i just got home i just walked in the house you going to let him disrespect us us aint nobody said shit to me aint nobody said shit to me now youve gotta give a confused asswhipping your mother said i got to fuck you up what i do i dont know i dont know what you did she said fuck you up or get fucked up i choose you im gonna fuck you up right now i know some women are thinking to themselves like so what kevin if its about having fun then just go have fun its not that easy having fun is a very difficult job the reason why i say that is because kids dont know how to shut fun off kids think fun lasts forever ill tell you the scariest shit in the world for a man to see after a long day at work long day at work you get home you put your key in the door you open up that door real slow scariest shit in the world for a man to see is that baby with all that energy on the other side oh yeah daddy home its time to play i want to play daddy ive been taking naps with mommy all day i

said the word no doesnt exist and thats what i meant we go to the amusement park in japan when we got there i have to be honest i was blown away the shit was incredible the reason why i was blown away is because i i was the tallest person in the park this is a true story its a true story they were calling me godzilla i gave advice that i never give telling people to drink milk eat their vegetable shit ive never said we go to get on a rollercoaster once again i dont do roller coasters but i said the word no doesnt exist and thats what i meant we go to get on this roller coaster and it made me

think and ive got friends that they take a shower with their mask on and they sleep with a mask on cause they have a hamster and the hamster probably has it and they live alone its just them and the hamster and i also have friends that i dont think have even heard about covid i it looks like someone told them to try to go get it thats how theyre living i have a lot of friends too they tell me they already had it theres a big theyre like i had it i had a fever uh february had a fever for a couple hours so probably had it i had one friend he told me he had it in  hes i mean convinced he goes i had it in  i was the first and it just didnt catch on like it has now but i can tell you one thing thats gone forever is coughing in public thats thats a wrap i mean you drink water wrong at a restaurant just go walk in traffic um whole restaurant just stops your table would be like get out of here get out of here you know who thatll hurt the most the cough in public my parents cause thats

buffalo wild wings they took my temperature you telling me that teenager doesnt\\xa0know what hes\\xa0doing\\xa0is that what youre dont think hes going to doctor school thats how they get started is

that and he goes youre fine  ive done pretty good during covid i uh cause i feel like you could either i lost some weight\\xa0during covid you could go two ways if you wanted to gain weight this is your time i mean everybodys fine with it you can just do it but ive been doing all that up until covid ive always lived by that rule so during covid i was like i need to stop and my neighbor started working out in his driveway so hes like lets work out in my driveway and you know its hard to make excuses during covid youre like im just so busy im just i cant i got a lot of stuff to do today and hes just out there so i started to do it with him and he had a trainer and im not a big fan of working out never done it and i told them i just wanna do upperbody stuff and they go all right well how about we just do legs every day thats all it is is legs i think its a huge conspiracy with trainers that you never actually do your upper body and when you are doing it i asked him is this upper body he goes yeah i go yeah cause im bending down quite a bit what i eat thats the main problem i eat like a child i eat i mean its not good he goes lets go through what you had for breakfast your whole day of eating he goes lets go through yesterday and in my head im like yesterdays not a good day lets pick another day uh he goes go through yesterday\\xa0i go all right i had donuts in the morning

los angeles and i was going to south by southwest in austin texas the next day and i had a really early flight i remember the night before i was like just be normal have a normal night and ended up hanging out became a bit of a problem  and i wake up the next day and my flight is gone ive missed it and its not like its at the gate it is in austin texas they are checking into their hotel so i go to get my phone to get another flight and ive lost my phone the night before ive lost it so now i dont have my phone so i have to go buy a ticket over the counter like its the  and when you walk up to a counter they dont expect you to be buying a ticket like that i got up there and theyre like all right i was like i would like one ticket to austin texas please and they said all right go buy it and dont be weird about it i go no id like to write a check to you for one ticket to austin texas they didnt have a flight so i have to do that at every terminal i just have keep going one ticket to austin texas please i finally found a flight but the girl\\xa0behind the\\xa0counter shes never sold a ticket like that ive worked here for ten years no ones ever done this i dont know how to do it she went back and got probably the oldest lady ive ever seen i think shes there for just this reason she came out she had that old credit card machine that you run shes like i got it ive been this is super fun for me it was weird to not have my phone everybody has their phone i was going through the airport and you just dont have it and you just stare i mean we were waiting in line and youre just looking ahead i mean people are just like all right dude what is wrong with you just regular people like wheres your phone im like i dont have it id like to talk to you though if youll talk\\xa0to me id love to chat for a little bit i thought i was going to breeze through security but i got held up cause of the guy in front of me he goes through the metal detector and it goes off and so they ask him do you have anything metal on you and he goes i have keys on me my keys and we thought he was gonna say his knee or hip you know just old people have metal in them a lot and he goes keys do you think that would do it youre like that would be the numberone answer on family feud of what would set a metal detector off keys i told him look lets try it with and without it id love to know maybe theyve been lying to us about this key thing so ive been doing these drivein shows these drivein movie theater shows and my buddy nic novickis been with me and nics a little person very fun we started comedy together nics very fun to be friends with very easy to trick we were once at a coffee shop and a guy was sitting near us with a big husky dog and nic just goes hey you think thats a wolf and i just said yeah i do think its a wolf uh they just passed a law that if you can catch a wolf you can have it as a pet he goes should i go ask him about it i was like absolutely i mean he wants to talk about it thats why he brought that wolf out here i watched him walk over to him and just go excuse me is that a wolf and the guy he didnt really know how to answer hes like what i mean you think i brought a wild wolf to this coffee shop and the wolfs just being cool about it its not losing its mind right now when we were doing these drivein shows we were all on a bus together i convinced nic that i didnt know who nancy kerrigan and tonya harding were nic is learning this that i do know who they are hes learning right now with you i never told him i absolutely know who they are he brought all his references are just  sports references  he only can reference the  so he brings up nancy kerrigan and tonya harding i was like whos that\\xa0hes like what you dont know who they are i was like i dont think anybody knows who they are he goes dude this was a huge story figure skating it was like a mafia hit i was like ive never heard this dude dont you think i wouldve heard it i was like no

stupid comedy thing its just whats that whatd she say  just helicopters all day thats an outside show the next specials going to be at lax its gonna be a good time uh   i cant wait to get back to the old days of just not doing good inside a building thats all you want you know theres one of the last kind of bombs i had so as comedians we do a lot of corporate events and i was doing this corporate event in tampa florida it was for this guy he ran tampas electricity or something i dont know what anybody does but he invented the electricity in florida so yeah hes doing real good and he was a very nice guy hes very generous it was all of his employees he was raffling off two cars he gave away a bunch of tvs\\xa0ipads i mean honestly probably  worth of gifts he was giving back to his employees very nice well i was one of these gifts that he was giving back so in the middle of giving this stuff away he stops and goes all right got a big surprise for you cant believe we got this guy to come here and he brings me out i mean nobodys heard of me at all theyre all looking at me like i think i could get this guy to come to my\\xa0house i mean who is i start doing my act i do one hour and just zero laughs i mean nothing and im not doing new jokes im doing the greatest hits i told the iced coffee with milk story three times i   it was  i kept just doing it i was like imma do it one more time i dont think yall were listening uh people were leaving the guy that drove me asked someone that left he goes is the comedy show almost over the guy goes i dont even know what youre talking about

and i lost it you know its over and he was very nice he goes no its all right nothings your fault i was like i dont know how thats possible and he goes well when you were up there i remembered that most of my employees do not speak english and i was like all right yeah thatll do it you know maybe dont hire an englishonlyspeaking comedian no heads up at all not that i could have changed it up but it just would have been nice to know  so i have a daughter and my daughters name is harper so a lot of people ask did you name her after harper lee the author of to kill a mockingbird and you know ive never thought about an author a day in my life so that never occurred to me i mean my middle name is lee and it just never crossed my mind uh i love having a kid we i love when kids cry its just innocent i love how innocent it is they cry over a tag in their shirt i mean they bawl they dont like it feels weird and then you could be like is your house on fire ive never seen someone cry this much its over nothing shes on her ipad a lot you know thats the hard part you got to get these kids off you dont want technology all the time she just sits there on her ipad she wants to be a youtuber which as a comedian makes me furious she watches these kid youtube videos and now she makes her own videos its just her sitting there going hey guys whats going on click the links below subscribe leave a comment none of this is anywhere but my phone i got  hours of this its not on youtube me and her mom are the only subscribers she just watches kids playing with toys like thats whats crazy its not like a show id be fine if she watched a show she watches just a kid thats like hey you dont have this toy i do you want to see me open it its got five billion views it looks like we buy her nothing like we just show her if you wanna watch a kid have fun but youll never have fun in this house we take her out we go do stuff i would take her to chuck e cheese all the time you can go there they had covid in  so theres yeah it cant even survive in there thats what chuck e cheese is rough i dont know if youve been there in a while they look like theyre trying to go out of business and they cant i they filed for bankruptcy and theyre still open they called blockbuster and were like how do you get out we want out  theyre updating nothing that chuck e band is just robotic i mean the drummer doesnt even turn on it just sits like that the whole time they sell booze to parents now they just give them buckets of bud light theyre drunk in a booth at  am when someone drives those kids home i dont see ubers and lyfts showing up there was a chuck e cheese that got caught if people didnt eat all their pizza ',\n",
       "  'theyd put it back out on the buffet and that would shut down any normal business and with chuck e cheese they have thrived i mean when i read the story i was like i thought thats what they were doing i thought we agreed thats fine i didnt know what the article was about our daughter still sleeps in our bed too and parents dont like that when you say it theyre like you gotta keep them outside dont look at them uh its my fault so we had a kid late in life we have one kid so were hitting all the sights and id be when i travel a bunch and id get home id want us to sleep in the bed together and ive built up a habit now its happened so its tough though because kids dont know how to sleep i mean she makes a king bed feel like a twin i mean im on the edge when i sleep alone in a hotel i sleep with my head on the nightstand its the only way i know how to go to bed she gets sideways upside down if you woke up upside down tomorrow you would go to the hospital shes also apparently going through menopause cause shes the hottest human being thats ever lived im freezing at night she kicks all the covers off youre like yeah you go ahead its your bed were lucky to be in it shes gotta get out at some point you know i dont know shell be  years old hey can i get in the bed with you guys her kids are upstairs asleep in their bed her husband left a while ago he aint gonna put up with that um i remember id fall out of a bunk bed i slept in a bunk bed i was on the top bunk and i would get over a railing and just fall six feet to the ground and just land i mean you dont catch yourself its just whatever hits first all your body weight just lands on your head i got a fullblown concussion im crying my parents are like just go back to a deep sleep for seven hours ive had three concussions in my life and none of them because of sports just living life man you know stuff happens to your head what are you going to do one was in high school i got pushed into a wall headfirst and it took them three class periods to figure out i had a concussion thats how much i was bringing to the table i mean two teachers didnt even notice and the third one was like he wasnt facing forward and thats when i realized hes one of the better facerforwards ive ever had so i knew my biggest concussion was when i was  years old i fell down a cliff so i grew up in old hickory tennessee and we used to climb down this cliff into old hickory lake and wed done it a ton of times and so one day i slip and fall so my friend that im with he goes and gets my mom there was a guy fishing in a boat down in the lake and so he sees me and he gets me into the boat he takes me over to some stairs which he had to be like why didnt he just use these stairs they were right next to that cliff  it didnt even make sense uh there was two guys at the bottom of the steps and he goes this kid fell can you carry him up so they carry me up and now my moms in an ambulance in her pajamas my dad who i think everybody knows now is a magician and hes doing a show in a full tuxedo so they get to the hospital the doctor starts talking to my parents i mean my mom looks homeless my dads in a tuxedo it looks it looks like theyre divorced and someones not paying child support so weve never known who was in the boat or the guys that carried me up the stairs weve never known who it was and we always wanted to thank them those guys truly saved my life and we could just never find out who it was so we never knew so i tell you that to tell you uh last year my dad is doing a show he does these magic shows in prisons so hes doing a show at a prison and during the show one of the inmates just stands up and says i know your son which is probably not the best place as a father to hear that just like i know your boy he keeps his mouth shut hes good people  so my dad he goes hey all right how do you know my son and he was one of the guys that carried me up those stairs that day i mean i promise i was  years old and wed never known who carried me up those stairs and it was him and his brother and then his brother saw me on the tonight show and was like thats that kid we carried up those stairs that day so its pretty crazy so since then ive been actually bringing him out to shows im gonna bring him out tonight and no hes not here hes in prison but you know sorry yeah trust me look he would love to be here trust me uh i mean yeah hed kill to be here to be honest but theres one day one day ill get him i did find out why he was in prison which was crazy so it was that same day so they just carried a body down those stairs and you can imagine the frustration to then be handed another body yeah and youre like dude are you serious like we just did this man you know all right that part i made up but the rest i swear the rest of it is true our daughter is in third grade and for first grade she started taking the bus and it was the first time she ever took the bus so you know as a parent you walk them to the bus stop its very fun so we got her on the bus she went to school at the end of the day someone from school called my cell phone they have my wifes cell phone they have my cell phone they called my cell phone and she said do you know what bus number your daughters supposed to be on an',\n",
       "  'd i said im her dad as in are you cra i was like this is how you thought youd get this information was to call the dad you saw mom and dads cell phone you go i bet the dad knows i was like do you have parents you ever seen a family before you thought lets call the husband unless theres two husbands you should never call a husband a day in your life id rather you ask a lady that doesnt know her i think she could get to the bottom of it quicker than i can i had to go get her all right ill come get her tell me the name of the school and ill come get her where does she go when you pack lunches now you got to be careful cause a lot of kids have peanut allergies now and our daughter actually has a cashew allergy with tree nuts and so i dont know what tree nuts are but it could kill my daughter the doctor goes cant have tree nuts and thats it he left and i was like wed love to know i didnt know where nuts came from but apparently they come from two different places and one of thems a tree i feel bad look i want to defend all these kids with peanut allergies i dont think they get defended they get yelled at by adults we got a lot of adults addicted to peanuts in this country and theyre furious i havent had peanuts in forever you take peanuts out of my life i dont think id notice and we just have adults are yelling at these children like they chose it like when they were born the doctor goes hey wanna be a nightmare to everybody every scenario is life and death you ever been on a plane they just announce it these planes just serve pretzels and be done with it but they try every flight and if they cant they just go all right everybody cant have peanuts today cause of that loser kid right there and these grownups are booing him the only reason im on the flight is for the peanuts i dont even know where its going were doing homework too our daughter started bringing it home homeworks fun first and second grade was awesome third grade youre like okay they throw some stuff in youre like oh all right all right its uh okay learning it earlier than we used to huh i dont even know if thats true but she brought home common core math thats fun its a new math they invented no heads up just give it to parents that never learned it uh its just a whole new i mean its unbelievable they bring it home you gotta watch a  youtube video on common core math i dont even understand it if you know it if you dont know common core its just a new math and the goal of common core is to use one sheet of paper for every problem you you just want to keep breaking the problem down you put the problem at the top and it just keeps going and then whats even funnier is you see old math in the middle of it as you break it down old math gets in there and youre like oh just do that at the top i dont even know what were doing its not like old math isnt working old math still i dont get incorrect change everywhere just going this stupid old math its a long way to get at the same answer i told my wife it feels like if you knocked on my front door and i opened it and you say can i come in and i was like do you mind coming in through the back door does the front door not work no it works i use it a lot of people still use it but the new way is to go jump the fence and come in the back and meet me at this same spot even though i make fun of common core i have learned stuff from elementary homework which is embarrassing im  my daughter is eight nothing should ever come out of her mouth that im like what what was that i learned when to use a or an in a sentence  i didnt know that there was a rule in play i thought you felt it out you know and just go that feels right and thats what you do i do the same thing with a comma ive never known where a commas supposed to go if i feel a commas coming i try to get out of that sentence so bad i mean i and if i cant i just put a comma and see if someone says something you know theyre like is that a comma im like is it my comma button has been sticking on my phone uh i remember nothing from school people talk about history to me im like i dont know when you guys learned that i think we skipped all of this i almost didnt graduate high school i had an f in science i was taking a class called science my senior year in high school i mean i had an f my dad went and talked to the teacher and said look just give him a d hes not gonna do science stuff and the teacher agreed to it she was that confident i wouldnt touch the science world i got we took acts and i got a  on it and if you dont know acts  is like thats not good man but you made it seventeen theyre like i dont even are you enrolled in this school like what are you doing the only thing i remember is in seventh grade we had a kid fistfight our pe teacher that stuck with me he was too old to be in seventh grade he drove to seventh grade if youre a seventh grade teacher and one of the kids drives you just know you gotta fight that kid one day theres its just happening like you people always talk to me very easy too or dumb if i talk to a stranger i can always feel it and i think its my eyes i have big eyes you know and so i just get a lot of you still with me man and im just sitting there like yeah man im listening he goes it felt like you c',\n",
       "  'ouldve been anywhere you know i got a reversible jacket at home and i have two of them cause i didnt know it was reversible bought them at the same time tried them both on separately liked the black one thought might as well get the blue one too went and laid them up there and i remember they go are you sure i go yeah i think i know what im doing here all right the dumbest ive ever been talked to i like to golf and so a guy was telling me theres a real golf course in north carolina where llamas are the caddies so if you dont know anything about golf a caddy usually carries your bag around tells you how far you are from the hole helps you out so this course they have llamas so you put your golf bag on a llama and it carries your bag so he told me that and then he looks into my big dumb eyes and he goes just so you know llamas cant talk though i mean thats the question he was trying to get ahead of as he looked into my stupid eyes like he just im going to say it so that guy doesnt have to say it im just at the zoo talking to the giraffes hey where you guys from you know i know where youre from but where are you from from  im gonna let this one go by you know the hard part is i see them coming before yall and i just see a blinking light like five miles away going that one looks like its coming in my head in my head im just like i think its you know couple times ive looked and it was just stars uh honestly i look up and ill be like that ones not moving that quick uh feel like ones just sitting on top of us youre like ah its the moon is it uh so im  years old and when i turned   was the first age i did not want to turn i remember my parents turning  it just feels old and its also the age that you do realize everybody youre talking to you are older than before youre  i think everybody you talk to is your age and for some reason when you turn  youre just older than that ill be talking to them like remember that it was   i wasnt born yet youre like golly are you serious dude in my eyes we look the same wheres your dad at let me talk to him cause i swear i thought you were my age one thing i got when i hit my forties was claustrophobia never had it actually got it here on the simpsons ride which is whats crazy i mean were  yards away from where my life fell apart i rode that ride with my daughter and were sitting on it and theres we had another buddy and he has his two girls on so we sit there and they pull the bar down and the bar my leg gets stuck in the middle and it just opened a door that i never knew was there i mean its just it is like a problem i had to stop the ride its super embarrassing to stop a childs ride and just be like im just waving like i cant do it then they open the bar and go you can do it again i was like im out and just no one got to ride it cause i couldnt ride it we all had to leave yeah ruined it for everybody uh and thats claustrophobia just kind of ruins everybodys time its the whats funny the panic of claustrophobia is pretty funny though its not funny when its happening to you but how quick you go from normal to just an insane person is just its all at the same time so its all kind of new to me so i forget i have it and ill put myself in a situation and i go there it is i got in an uber once with like seven people we get in i go ill get in the third row try to be a good guy i climb in the back they put all the seats up and it just starts hitting me im back there like  just trying to be normal you know not talking then you go hey you think you can roll the window down you know what can everybody just get out of the van real fast  just were just driving down the interstate could yall crack the window do you mind if i drive the uber you think i could drive it so i was born in  and the reason i say that cause if you are my age or just right around my age very like maybe  to  you might realize or maybe you dont know ive never been called a millennial or generation x id never even really heard any of those terms growing up and now you hear them all the time so i looked it up to see i was like what am i and im technically nothing im on a cusp im a generation gap and what we are called xennials or were called the oregon trail generation or were called my favorite name is the lucky ones and its true were very lucky we actually grew up in two different worlds when i was a kid i grew up like it was the  you would go outside and your parents just didnt know where you were we went to school and played oregon trail on a computer at school no one had a computer at home what are you a zillionaire like i mean you couldnt but then in high school i had aol we had a computer at home then i got a beeper and then i got a cellphone i didnt have social media until i was  with myspace you know i mean social media like whatever i did in high schools a rumor it cant ruin my life so if youre around my age you might realize you end up always being in the middle like i understand when a genxer says something youre like i get it a millennial says something i get it you always feel in the middle and these groups all hate each other the most ive ever felt where i was in the middle is just this one hotel that i stayed at so a lot of hotels now they have chromecast and you can watch',\n",
       "  ' netflix in your hotel room so im watching i get in my room and i turn it on my chromecast is not working so i called down to the front desk and the oldest voice i ever heard answered the phone this guy was a civil war survivor i mean he he was the age where you just go thank you for your service like was he in the army youre like probably man theres an age where they all had to go at that age so just say it uh so i tell him hey my chromecast is not working i couldve just made up a word hes never heard of that i could have said my beepbop broke i mean he asked if i was staying at that hotel thats how confused he goes are you staying here i was like do you think ive called a front desk from a different hotel room so he goes look i dont know what this is but theres a younger guy here ill send him up hell help you and i was like great so that guy comes up and he knocks on my door i open it hes my dads age right when i see him youre like all right dude we dont have to do this you know i mean i know youve heard of it but if i cant fix it youre not gonna be able to fix it but hes the generation that still wants to give it a try so i gotta let him in so he comes in my room sits on my bed a little too far back i thought uh i just remember the back of his calves were touching the bed and i was like are your feet dangling how far back are you gonna go uh are you cold do you want some covers man he gets the remote and just starts pressing all the buttons i said i dont know if thatll do it he goes lets just keep trying it though i go all right uh  ill turn the shower on open a window lets try everything lets just see maybe it turns on who knows maybe its all connected we cant get it and he goes all right theres a younger guy hes about to come to work at this point im like im the younger guy i was like its all right dude i dont need it he goes no its a millennial and i was like now were getting somewhere you know this is what the millennial does he was born with technology hell know how to fix this i was excited i was like great he goes he comes to work in an hour i go wonderful let me tell you know how quick that millennial fixed it ill never know cause he just didnt come to work that night so didnt call in nothing i found out cause the old guy called me cause he was supposed to fill in for him he was furious dude he hates that millennial he goes he never comes to work he doesnt take it serious hes got a peanut allergy i was like all right well i ended up fixing it myself because it was just unplugged so yeah thats my fault uh  the next morning i dealt with my daughters generation which is a generation that i feel like just thinks about themselves you know and so i go down to breakfast they have the breakfast buffet were all going through it this little girls in front of me and she has waffles so she gets a waffle and theres a coffee pot worth of syrup sitting on a plate so you pour it and you leave it back on the plate and then you go and eat your breakfast so she gets the syrup and she just takes it to her table so now the syrups gone and i see this happen but no one else does so im hearing people go through and asking where the syrups at its starting to become a problem people are like wheres the syrup the hotels like i dont know thats all the syrup we have was out there i know where its at but im not trying to get involved i didnt wake up and think i hope i get to talk to everybody this morning when you roll out of bed youre not like i hope im about to get in the thick of it down there so im just trying to say stuff as i walk by people maybe someone took it to their table look around maybe i just like keep going you see that little girls table over there maybe they have it and no ones picking up on this so i just have to go get it this girls sitting with a bunch of her friends so i go over to them and i was like hey can we get that syrup back thats kind of for the entire hotel and she goes they go whatever all of them just blew me off then the father in me kicks in i go all right just a heads up just so you guys know i did nothing wrong and you guys have ruined breakfast for everybody i dont know if youve ever eaten out in public before but do you see me over here with the tub of eggs do i have all the eggs you did everything else and for some reason you thought i bet this is all my syrup and where are your parents at a couple of them started crying felt good to be honest i was away for a little bit i like to practice on other children you know my discipline and to make fun of my generation just so it doesnt seem like im trying to skip over another hotel i was at another syrup incident actually i mean im a big fan of waffles with syrup im around syrup quite a bit and were at a holiday inn express so the breakfast buffet there they have the cereal where you turn the knob and four pieces fall out its like how you feed a cat for a long weekend you know youre like thats enough uh they had batter and syrup they had the waffle iron where you make it yourself you pour batter on the waffle iron you shut it turn it over it locks it cooks for two minutes you turn it over you open it half the waffle comes off half stays forever thats how you eat a waffle im with a buddy of mine thats my a',\n",
       "  'ge so we go through hes in front of me not really talking or anything just going through he gets to it the batter and syrup theyre in clear containers theyre not labeled but theyre in clear containers he gets the syrup and starts pouring it on the waffle iron im not even stopping him cause hes not doing it going ive never done it hes doing it where were probably going to try it after i mean hes just like youre like dude i cant wait to see what this guys making he might know something that i dont know he shuts it turns it over it cooks hes looking at us were like i mean the whole lines like yeah what is that going to be and it makes black smoke is what it makes just i mean dark black smoke just starts filling the lobby the manager comes over what are you doing i guess i poured the wrong one these are not labeled the guys like theyre in clear containers do you not know the difference of batter and syrup hes like i bet it happens all the time he goes ive worked here my whole life ive never seen this so they threw the waffle iron they just throw it away thats what they have to do just throw it away its over now theres no waffles we went from all about to get a waffle to its upside down in a trash can then he just turns and looks and its just a line of people with that little foam plate and just everybodys sad i just hear someone in the back go i set my alarm for this two guys didnt have shoes on i ran down with no shoes in that elevator i thought i was gonna miss it so my parents are in their sixties and when your parents hit their sixties just so you know you kinda realize you go all right im in charge of this family now you know they dont give it up they dont offer it away they just start doing stuff that youre like i dont know you know we went to the store the other day and we walk back to the car we were in the store for an hour we walk back my dads the drivers side door is wide open he drove got open the door to go inside and just kept walking hes been driving for  years and i know cars are getting crazy but one thing thats stayed the same in all these  years is you gotta open and shut that front door my dad wore my moms pants to a funeral that was the day i was like we cant listen to this guy no more you know we gotta go get him he doesnt know whats happening it usually starts happening when you start doing the holidays at your house instead of your parents house thats when it starts and so my parents once we did that they downsized to a twobedroom townhome so they still wanted to do thanksgiving at their house but they dont have the room for us theres like  of us its like a college kid being like wanna do christmas in my dorm room theres a table for four and then they have to put a train of tv trays and nightstands that just weaves down this hallway youre sitting on stairs we made the kids go eat in the car we just go go back in the car you cant even eat inside my mom didnt have ketchup i was like everybody just has ketchup it just comes in houses if i went to some alcoholics house hed have ketchup his whole familyd be gone but id say you have ketchup hed be like im not that gone man so i was i grew up in the  and  i was a kid in the  and  during the  and  kids were getting kidnapped pretty rapidly and look im not trying to say we were more desirable or something i i think we were outside more a lot more opportunity you know also a lot easier to get us into vans uh didnt take much and so parents back then they would watch tv and i think it would scare the parents you know you realize now now everythings a crime show everything you watch is crime podcasts are crime movies are crime you almost see it so much but back then you only had so many channels and when theyd watch these shows they were very powerful shows my parents used to watch a show called rescue  and it would just show reenactments of crimes and it was powerful ive seen three seconds of rescue  i remember walking through the living room my parents are watching it i look at the tv a guy has a ski mask on a woman is asleep with her feet out from under the covers and he started rubbing her foot thats all i saw i kept walking i dont know what happened before or after but i know ive never been able to sleep with my feet out from under the covers because i accidentally saw that  years ago and my feet get so hot and i want to put em out so bad i mean i try it every night for  years and then that image pops in my head and i yank em right back under ill be in a hotel room like he cant get in here dude youve locked everything im like thats exactly what hes been waiting for hes probably already in here so my parents i think watched a rescue  where a kid went missing so it got em scared and i think they took it as look you guys are getting kidnapped theres nothing we can do its happening so they wanted us to be prepared for it so instead of like i dont know selfdefense give us a gun i dont know something what they did was you know how you always hand out flyers if a kid goes missing theyre like lets just get that flyer ready well just do that you know if a kid goes missing they always have a flyer they put a picture of the kid and all the information below so the height weight eye color all that stuff so instead of ma',\n",
       "  'king a flyer what they made us do was we wrote on a piece of paper our name height weight eye color and then we just held it up against the wall and they just took a picture of us so the picture is us holding our own information and they said when the cops are like hey lets get a flyer ready well be like well weve been rooting for this to happen we already have one made well give that to the police which if we would have been kidnapped my parents would be in prison right now no ones going to believe you pretook pictures theyll just look at this and be like just tell us where the kids are at that would be the easiest thing to do ive never seen this ever they had to go get that printed at walmart too you couldnt do that at home you had to go show people that youre crazy we walked in walmart the guys probably like could i talk to your kids by themselves for a bit id love to chat with them so im uh married as well we me and my wife just celebrated our  wedding anniversary and thank you  uh weve been together for  years and i met her it was before i ever started comedy we both worked at applebees together is where we met were big applebees fans still to this day  hold

weve gone a little bit farther than i expected you know  i told her i wanted to be a server one day shes like you keep dreaming that dream all right i think if you try hard you can get that menu memorized me and my wife so im the dreamer of our group i feel like in a marriage one of you is a dreamer you know moneys not real lets have fun lets go do fun stuff as much as we can and the other person hates fun thats how you make a marriage you cant have two dreamers youll be homeless in an hour you need someone that walks around is fun happening id like to put a stop to that are yall having fun stop it is the air conditioning on turn it off i married my dad is who i married my dad who i thought air conditioning cost  a day to run it wed be on car rides i thought if you turned it on your car exploded like just gas you were out immediately someone turn the air conditioner on my wifes always around too i feel just always like near you know especially at home its like i married a cat im like youre just always on me if i go to the bathroom shes like im gonna paint the bathroom door while youre in there im like you couldnt do it later no i had all the time to do it i thought id wait till you went in thats when i was gonna start if i eat something she doesnt approve of she just pops up man i mean ill try to sneak it i could eat an oreo cookie in the attic at  am and i would bet my life a light would cut on and shed be like what are you doing up here if i question it like what are you doing here shes like im always here this is when i do my attic stuff she put  on my phone so they can track you even when theyre not near you you might not even know you have it on your phone its worse than what the governments doing i would rather the government track me than her she calls me why are you at krispy kreme doughnuts im like im not gonna live like this all right if i want donuts im not gonna lock my phone in a gym locker and go pay cash for donuts ive done it but im not

good just ridiculous fight was over the saying one fell swoop just over that saying  my wife and i hold on let me this is the last one i just hear one in the background cause you hear it from a far distance and then its like hes going that way doesnt it sound like hes going the other way right yall are like we dont even hear it and im just up here i mean just haunts me for the rest of my life every show were back doing theaters im like is that you guys hear a helicopter youre like inside the buildin',\n",
       "  'g im like yeah does everybody hear it everybody get down quiet down is that a helicopter in this all right so we got in the fight over the phrase one fell swoop just over this saying and if youre a newlywed and youre like that doesnt make sense youre right it doesnt this is a doubledigit married fight this is when youve already done all the dish fighting or the puttingyourclothesaway fighting this is when theyre trying to mentally break you uh they got you almost how they want you and this is the one that sends it over the edge so my wife wanted to go visit her parents one weekend and her parents are divorced which has been hardest on me to be honest thats something people dont talk about when you marry into divorce they divorced because of her not me so why do i have to go to  different houses  so she wanted to visit her parents she said i wanna do it in one fell swoop now ive never heard my wife say the phrase one fell swoop weve been together  years shes never said it it felt like someone that day told her hey you should start using one fell swoop more she goes im about to call my husband it goes perfect use it  to  times on him she calls and goes i wanna visit my parents in one fell swoop i go lets do it in one fell swoop she goes i wanna do it in one fell swoop i go lets do it in one fell swoop lets swoop it up im down she kept saying it one fell swoop over and over again and then when she went to describe this one fell swoop trip she goes well go to my moms come home then go to my dads and so i just like waited and she didnt say anything and i just go thats not what one fell swoop means and instead of possibly just being wrong she goes i know what one fell swoop means i go yeah it doesnt sound like you do all right we have the same last name i cant have you out there in a one fell swoop conversation what do you think two birds one stone means lets go through them all i dunno if you know any of these she hangs up on me so i get home and you know when you walk home and youve been in a fight and youre like all right how long is this fight is it happening still is it over i dont know i got to feel it out you know she never uses words like sorry id love to hear that thats a word she definitely doesnt know what it means i say it all the time i walk around the house with a sack of sorrys just handing them out all day i tried to give her some would you like to carry these shes like i dont have pockets so im good we didnt talk that whole night were sitting there our daughter were watching tv eating and im like hey you know your moms crazy right shes like did you do your homework you dont wanna be dumb like your dad and then our daughters just like are yall lunatics so im laying on the couch and my wife just came over and she kisses me goodnight and then she went to bed and that was it you know i felt like it was her sorry i guess but she didnt say it so i laid there just thinking about it you think about it a lot cause you learn the longer youre married sometimes its like let stuff go you know who cares the next morning i get up and i still want to talk about it cause we didnt talk all night you know so i went to her i was like look i got to tell you i mean its just not what it means you know and that that got it going real good uh but i felt so good about this argument you know i thought about it all night i was like you got this one in the bag man you should bring it back up im not trying to date her anymore id like to win a fight were gonna die together i almost woke her up in her sleep thats how much i was so excited i almost started shaking her going its not what it means our marriage almost ended in one fell swoop so all right thank you guys so much for coming out to this truly appreciate it   got the

       "  'ople have opinions i dont got none i like political and so sometimes before i go to a party ill just turn on the tv and whatever that guy said ill say that but im not good like when i go to parties i dont want serious discussions i try to find somebody that is at my same level and im good at it i can like you know how they say guys have gaydar – they can see other gay people im like that with guys at my same level of smartness like i can see a guy in the corner and go i can keep up with that motherfucker right there and then i make a beeline for that character and then we talk about jughead comics for a couple of hours and everythings fine sometimes people go why do you even go to these parties if you dont like you know talking heres why i go to parties theres only one reason why i go to parties the reason why i love parties because i love those little sandwiches where theyre triangles and they cut the crusts off and then theyre little equilateral triangles and they put a little toothpick and it has like golden cellophane and red cellophane i can eat   of those fuckers and you can only get them at parties like i have gone to restaurants and i go you got any of them sandwiches that are shaped like triangles and they go no all our sandwiches are shaped like sandwiches i go oh fuck and then i go to like a grocery store i go yes where is what aisle is the sandwiches with the toothpicks they go we dont got none have you tried a party i go im trying not to go to those things but i dont drink so im no good at parties for that reason and drugs i dont do them used to when i was a boy young i would do anything you know lsd that was about the strongest drug i ever did – acid i dont know if youve ever done acid but when i was young they would tell me you have got to be careful with that acid on account of you can do it and then you have a flashback like ten years could pass  years could pass and then you get a flashback so i thought well that sounds like a good deal you know i went to my drug dealer frank i said frank is there a drug on the market where i pay you  i take the drug i get high and then  years later i get high again he said yes and i think of myself as somebody whos good at stretching his drug dollar but the point of the whole thing is for me to tell you young folk that its not its not true at all you know because i have not done lsd since i was a teenager ten years have passed  years have passed sadly  years have passed and still no flash what a gyp that turned out to be i just more horseshit by the big acid companies if you ask me i dont want to i dont want to get too political but if you think big acid cares about you the little guy they care about their thirdquarter profits thats what they care about you know my friend is a vegetarian and have you ever been wrong and you suddenly realize you know like because she all her arguments are right about vegetarianism shell go like how can you kill an animal when you can get the same from the grass of the field it makes no sense and then i go i like pork so of course shes right and im wrong and its weird when you realize you have been wrong about everything that you ever believed – about vegetarianism not everything imagine if you woke up and you realized you were wrong about everything you just woke up and you go goddamn i have been wrong about every single thing i have ever believed then its time to go down to the rope store in my opinion because its not going to get better you know go to the rope store – thats my suggestion to you and get a hunk of rope about this big and then go to the ricketystool store and listen its no coincidence that the rope store and the ricketystool store are always right beside each other right i dont want ',\n",

me on the internet not because of what they said more so because its probably something i would have said and then im mad that my own words are getting used against me like i posted something for this tv show i was on and somebody goes holy shit did you eat your whole cast and i was like damn it i would have said that to i probably would have said that too and then somebody posted a picture with me and somebody commented and went russell peters looking thicker than a snicker i got mad at that because i love a good rhyme thicker than a snicker thats a good one too its not a fair way to describe a human i think thicker than a snicker is a great way for me to describe my penis i think its a wonderful way to describe it so russell tell me about your penis well its thicker than a snicker equally dark and vain texture packed with nuts and it satisfies  so i said to my doc i said doc it doesnt make sense that i should be getting as fat as im getting he said why not i said because i dont eat crazy and i train jujitsu every other day hes like huh how old are you now i said  he goes and youre indian i go yeah but– he goes and you havent had a heart attack yet he goes– i said no i havent had a heart attack yet he goes all right so he takes blood and i leave calls me back in three days later i go back in hes like hey i got your blood back i know whats wrong i go whats wrong he goes its your thyroid i go what about it he goes you have an underactive thyroid i go so what does that mean it means its not doing enough i said i understand what the fuck underactive means he goes then why did you ask i said how is it affecting me he goes the thyroid is making you fat i go the thyroid is making me fat he goes no youre doing things too but the thyroid is really helping i go so what do we got to do he said weve got to speed your thyroid up i said lets get that bitch movin',\n",
       "  'g right so its been a year and a half now and i lost  pounds from it but it wasnt me it was the medication its not me and ive lost– like my bodys in much better shape than its ever been but my fucking head is fat as shit and i dont know– i dont know how to– i look like a fucking thumb  do you know how hard it is to lose a fat head its almost impossible i used to box theres tricks when you want to lose weight from your body in boxing you could put on a garbage bag and you go sit in the sauna and you sweat it off let me give you some friendly advice you cant do that with your head i know i found out the hard way i was like you know what i got this i grabbed a plastic bag i threw it over my big stupid head im not an idiot i cut a hole from my nose it was a substantial hole and i went sat in the sauna but i forgot when you have a larger nose and you inhale you tend to suck up more than the average human and i took a deep breath in the sauna and sucked up the plastic bag and my friends thought i was trying to commit suicide in the dumbest way possible but when i got fat i got like a weird kind indian people we get the worst kind of fat like it just goes everywhere like white people do you ever see white americans when they get fat its just bam a belly and you cant tell from behind hey look at the white guy he turns around and like hello but indians it just shows up in the weirdest places like i started to grow tits but not in front on the side i dont know what the fuck they were going but–  i was growing side tits and they were like arm rests i was walking around after a while i was– it was like i was going to go into a pool with some floaties on the whole time and then i was getting a fat back that was a weird thing to get it was like fat on my back i would sit down and my fat back would hang over the chair and im like what the fu– i would grab it and go this feels nice but not on me i dont like this and then i had a chunk of fat like a big– like right here– a big huge clump of fat like when a woman gets fat here its called a gunt because its a gut right above her– you know i mean so its a gunt and i guess when i had it its a gock i guess it would be a gock i guess i dont know literally for a year and a half i didnt see my penis i would have to lift it up to visit you still there buddy ok good and id rest it dont worry the sun will shine one day so my doctor says hey what else is wrong with you i go what do you mean what else is wrong with me he goes look youre a  indian man im like thats really fucking racist but since you asked i have acid reflux i dont know does anybody else– who else has acid reflux in here first of all youre lying to me right now because there is no way you can be indian and not have fucking acid reflux its inevitable theres no way you can consume the food that we eat with that much spice and that much oil and that much butter and not just have it burn a hole in your– as my dad would say– your esophagus what son its burning your esophagus dad i want to assure you i have no phagus in me no no son esophagus i dont care whose phagus you think this is theres no way you dont have acid reflux im looking at all of you especially all the pudgy guys you know exactly who has it you got it dont you yellow guy you do do you hes like i know i have it but i dont want to say because my shirt looks like turmeric so– ive had acid reflux my entire life– my entire life and i remember being six years old– and heres the worst thing about having acid reflux its triggered by food and when you grow up in an indian house and your food is indian food and this food triggers your fucking acid reflux and you cant eat indian food anymore youre a piece of shit like i remember going to my mom mom i cant eat indian food anymore mom goes what do you realize people in india are dying to eat this food literally dying i said mom do you understand that im dying if i eat this food literally dying i was six years old i remember this clearly i was six years old and i remember burping and fire shot up my chest and flames came out my nose and i remember clearly because there was tears coming down my eyes and i remember going im crying and im not crying im very confused and i go to my mom i go mom mom its burns when i burp my mom goes what i said it burns when i burp oh my god it burns when he burps oh my god son ok do this dont burp  that was your big piece of advice mom im like im serious mom its burning she goes ok ok yeah yeah here drink some milk drink some milk i drank the milk nothing mom its still burning never mind dad dad its still burning my dad goes ok ok see the yogurt on the table eat the yogurt what eat the yogurt what do you mean eat the yogurt son its a fact whats a fact if you eat the yogurt it will cool you down youll feel better how is that– its a fact son how is that a fact son do you even know what yogurt is yogurt is a probiotic when you get sick what does the doctor give you antibiotic  dad im six years old i dont know what a fucking biotic is son one is for biotics and one is against biotics i said i still dont know what a biotic is son just eat the bastard yogurt i go why because why do you think indian people keep yogurt on the table when we eat food to help your digestion i said ok now that makes sense so i grabbed a bowl of the yogurt i start eating it well fuck me in the eye theres chilies and onions in the yogurt why why did we spice the yogurt th',\n",
       "  'ats what triggers the burning and indian parents will become racist at the drop of a dime i go dad why did we spice the yogurt he goes how else are you going to eat yogurt plain were not white people i said dad thats really racist is it racist or is it a fact how is that a fact son what color is plain yogurt  what does plain yogurt taste like nothing what is the contribution from white people to the food of the world nothing its a fact so my doctor says to me hey i just called downstairs to the clinic in the lobby and i got you an endoscopy appointment i go what he goes when was the last time you had an endoscopy i said never let me tell you something doc ive never shoved anything in my ass he said what the fuck are you talking about i said doc im not an idiot all right i know what an endoscopy is its in your end os copy he said no you fucking idiot its in your mouth i said hey yo it may be in your mouth doc but it aint in my mouth bro i mean what you do outside of here is none of my business man thats why i like my doctor because he swears at me when he talks to me i trust him for that reason alone i dont trust people that dont swear people that dont swear youre hiding something theres something wrong with you you probably touch kids im telling you theres something wrong with people that dont swear theres something wrong theyre hiding something and people that dont swear act like theyre better than you because they go out of their way to let you know they dont swear i dont know i just find better ways of communicating than using foul and obscene language its like  you keep an eye on those people theyre hiding some– theres something really dark going on in their head theyve got some dark dark secrets and they dont want you to know about it you see them the people that are too nice theyll be too friendly too polite you know they got dark stuff going on in their head theyll be like well the wife and i had a lovely dinner with you all tonight we hope you all have a wonderful night of digestion were going to reconvene to the bedroom and at which point in the morning well collect again and enjoy a delicious breakfast together and at which point we shall discuss the nights events with that i wish you all good night and pleasant dreams and they go to the bedroom and he closes the door and hes like all right honey shit on my chest because they got dark dark things going on in there heres the good news i swear ill never shit on your chest i like how uncomfortable that made all of you im just trying to do the math on the shitting on the chest its– what is the purpose of this my doctor says listen i called downstairs to the clinic in the lobby and i got you an endoscopy appointment i go when he goes right now i go so what do i gotta do he said you got to go downstairs to the lobby and go to the clinic and i go and when is this going to happen he said right now i said ok so where is this going to happen he says at the clinic in the lobby i go no no on me he goes oh in your mouth i go so whats going to happen in my mouth he says theyre going to give you an endoscopy i go and it just takes place in my mouth he goes yeah i go theyre not going to touch my asshole are they he said do you want them to touch your asshole no theyre not going to touch your asshole i said ok doc i just want to confirm that this procedure is strictly in my mouth he goes that is correct i said ok im going to go but i swear to god doc if they try and touch my asshole im coming back up here and im fucking you up he goes go you idiot so i go now heres the problem my doctor knows me he knows what kind of person i am he knows ive been a comedian for  years he knows how my brain works he knows how i have no filter see comedians look at the audience we look at you guys and go those are civilians you guys are civilians you know how to do this sit around each other and be normal just sit around and go– i dont– i dont have that fucking filter i have to– as soon you see– as soon as i walk out–  but these people in the clinic dont know me like that so i cant go in and be me so i have to do my impression of how i think you would handle this situation so i walk up to the clinic and im like hi im here for my endoscopy appointment its in the mouth she goes yes sir we know where it is please come around ok so i walk around and she hands me a hospital gown and says ok sir just go down the hall take off your clothes put this on and well get started i said uh– um i think theres a misunderstanding here my doctor upstairs he told me that this procedure just takes place in my mouth she goes thats correct i go oh well then hang on to the gown lets just go get started she goes no no sir you have to– you cant have your clothes on when we do this procedure i said that doesnt make any sense because if its just my mouth you need access to–  im not fighting you on this im not even blocking my mouth im here to help pick a chin which one do you like ill hold it down for you shes like sir its policy that you cannot have your street clothes on when we do this procedure i said you know its funny you should say that because i too have a policy and my policy is that i like as many layers as possible protecting my asshole at all times she said sir would you just go put the fucking gown on i said whoa you swore all right so i go down to the change room and im standing there and im buck ass naked right and i start getting really pa',\n",
       "  'ranoid about my ass and then i get a brilliant idea i take the hospital gown and i put it on backwards smart right right to protect it but then i look down my dick is just swinging just like–  look its my story ill make my penis as big as i want it to be all right its india youre all like come on bro thats not even believable ok not even on a humid day its true it was cold in there too you know i just– you know what i mean it was embarrassingly small it just looked like three coins and a mushroom cap it was just terrible it was the worst oh man you know what i mean you know what i mean right you know what i mean have you ever had it shrivel up so much that you bend forward and it inverts youre like hey where did my dick go youre like dick no dick dick no dick my black security guys never get that joke i dont get it if i bend forward the motherfucker hits the floor  so im like well this is embarrassing so i put the gown on the right way and i walk back in the room and she goes all right mr peters just hop up here and well get started so i hop up on the table but i put my ass right against the wall because like i said i train jujitsu if you want to come at me when im on my back its your funeral not mine and she goes all right sir just so you know during this procedure were going to be putting you under using propofol i said wait wait a minute propofol isnt that the shit that killed michael jackson she goes yes yes it is i go what do you mean yes yes it is why are you so happy about this it killed the biggest pop star of my lifetime and you think its just ok for me to take she said sir michael jackson was having an improperly administered i said michael jackson was having many things improperly administered but wasnt his doctors name dr conrad murray yes wasnt he a doctor yes well whats your title im an anesthesiologist i said look i dont care what your zodiac sign is all right i dont even know what month that is she said sir my job is to make sure you go to sleep and wake up i say  i said that is a fine answer and i will accept that she goes great please lay on your side i said no no no why why do i got to lay on my side i lay on my side you knock me out you lift up the dress you flip up a butt cheek you start stuffing me like a turkey im not falling for this trick lady she said sir you need to lay on your side because when we give you the propofol youre going to pass out and youre going to fall over and when you fall over you could hurt yourself so to avoid any injury you need to already start on your side i said that is a fair answer she goes great so i lay on my side but i tuck my ass in real tight on the wall and she goes why dont you count down from five with us and i go all right five four thwump out cold i dont know if any of youve been put under at the doctor but– sir have you been put under at the doctor youre an older gentleman i mean not older but you know youre not these fucking kids you know what i mean whats your name sandeep and how old are you sandeep   were the same age same shit and have you been put under at the doctor i got an endoscopy russell peters you had an endoscopy endoscopey he

than me but you know whats– you know what im not looking forward to next year ill be  and uhuh because you know what happens at  theyve got to go with the old–  you know  you know what im talking about   im running out of noises sandeep all right sir how old are you huh audience  russell peters  did you have the old  not yet you havent done it yet what the fuck are you waiting for youre  you

indias got one circling mars the chinese have got shit on the moon and no  years later still  im still puzzled that you were awake when this shit happened i cant imagine how uncomfortable that would have been yeah they knock you out and they give you propofol let me just too you something about this propofol shit its incredible i get it michael i get it its an amazing drug and im not a drug guy

know its going to be dumb– you know how humans are an ever evolving species like if you looked at humans from  years ago you go what the fuck were those well in  years those humans are going to look at us and go what the fuck were those well so because of evolution and my own ego i thought that i was evolving at a faster rate than you  and that my body to accommodate the larger nose had developed some sort of joint hinge system in here to alleviate the weight i dont know im not a doctor he goes youre fucking retarded i said doc you actually cannot say that anymore what that youre fucking retarded yeah you cant say retarded anymore doctor no i can say it no you cant because its offensive to people im not talking about anybody else im talking about you youre a fucking retard and i go no

learn how to fake orgasms thats their way around having kids let me explain to you first of all women dont need to know how to fake orgasms because they do it all the time and women dont fake orgasms because they cant have them women fake orgasms because men are fucking idiots because heres the problem',\n",
       "  ' with men we either dont pay enough attention to a woman or we fixate on one spot were like ha ha ha ha ha ha and shes like ow ow ow ow ow ok ow ow ow ow but we dont hear the ow part all we see is– that must be the spot dont leave that spot er er er ow ow er er ow ow er er ow ow er er ow ow and the only way to get you to stop if she goes ah and then you are going yeah i did that and shes like no you idiot i was going numb you need to learn how to fake an orgasm preag let me show you how when it comes to faking an orgasm with a woman its very technical i have made up a list of suggestions i recommend if youre going to fake an orgasm with a woman you should be behind her– having sex not just standing there thatd fucking weird if you just– oh  what the fuck was that so you should be behind her having sex with her– with her– at same time yeah i recommend youre behind the woman because when youre behind a woman its easier to fake its harder for them to check your work because when youre behind a woman very rarely does a woman turn around and go was that good never because you know why its not an attractive angle women dont want to look like what so when youre behind its like a horse in a race just  you never see a horse going  so you should be behind her and let me ask you something you guys are fucking obviously whats your name sorry – sohill russell peters sohill and your name sweetheart shabina russell peters kibera what audience shabina russell peters sha– shamuch pisha shabina subpoena wait like as in youve got to go to court tomorrow shabina russell peters savita shabina russell peters shabina that was like  different versions of the same name i just heard shabina ok im going im going to prove to every woman in here that all men including myself every man in here has add every single one of us ok shabina you ever doing it with sohill and hes behind you and you can feel him slow down and then speed up and then slow down and speed up and youre thinking oh my little sosos got–  my little soso has moves let me tell you something thats not what it is let me tell you what happened its add thats exactly what the fuck happened heres what happens ladies we get behind you were good for the first two strokes and then after that add were like this yeah all right  i got to change that light bulb when im done oh shit let me get back to it thats what happens ok preag pay attention bastard hello  so when it comes to faking the orgasm you dont have to do anything crazy all right youre just doing your normal sex that you guys do and dont act like you do all kinds of fancy shit in the bedroom ok people we all know once youre in a relationship for a while theres the three basic positions theres the us the her the you thats all there is its three moves one to get it started this ones for us ok now its your turn sweetheart and then my turn thats what happens and heres some good reasons as to why you should fake an orgasm because youre not ready to deal with a pregnant woman its a very different– are you pregnant sweetheart i could tell because youve got a thin face and then youre holding your stomach and fat people never do that so when are you due four weeks russell peters in four oh wow youre right– like right there and is this your first child and is she extra horny right now its true it happens  its a fact its true they get really horny towards the end of the pregnancy and its very uncomfortable for us because my girl when she was pregnant she was like towards the end she was like why dont you want to have sex with me and i go its– oh my god you think im fat i go i dont think youre fat i know youre pregnant then why would you have sex with me im like i physically dont have enough equipment anymore to get in there because she got real big when she was pregnant i was like i cant she was like ill get on top and i go no because she gets on top then her stomach pushes me further away and im like huh huh and nothing because i cant reach it just my balls hitting her in the back  nothing happening its like that scene in back to the future where docs trying to connect the wire come on marty  ok so youre doing your three positions right its a regular lovemaking day you know you do us her and now its on to you so youre behind her doing your thing you dont have to do anything extra you just do it like normal you want to set off any alarms and when it comes time where you feel like now is when i want to fake my orgasm this is where the work comes in you have to sell it you have to make a really believable noise first of all all right and it has to be a noise that youre not going to accidentally do in the middle of the day all right and its going to be a big noise you dont want to be like oh no thats– thats not it all right its got to be big and– but like something– like what i do is when it comes time for me to fake an orgasm what i do is i just grab her ass out of nowhere really hard i go  and then i go ah because im never going to make that noise ever in my day not unless im doing an impression of a reporter from the  russell peters la times can i get a quote ah so youve got to go  ah and thats only the beginning now you have to sell the orgasm thats where the work comes in so its  ah   you literally have to act when her vagina is electrocuting you and then when youre done you just collapse you die you die you fall over and then shell be like wow that was a good one huh youre lik',\n",
       "  'e yeah that was a good one yeah pay attention though a couple of seconds later shes going to go hey youre not leaking out of me you go no no thats because i shot that one way up there i launched that one its in there deep whatever you do dont burp because its going to come out  you know indian parents like the nri indians theyre very different than you guys you may not believe me but you guys are far more forward thinking than they are heres the problem with the indians that left india they left india in whatever year they left and thats what year india is stuck in  if they left in – if they left in  india is still  to them they cant imagine all this shit is happening no no russell that would never happen in india yeah come come motherfucker you should see youre going to see they do they try they hang on to shit that doesnt even exist in india anymore they try to be overly indian and their whole reason for leaving was bullshit because theyll do this no i want to leave and give my children a better life give them opportunities expose them to different things let them experience a new world and then what do they do they have the kids born and raised in america and then around  they go son we know youre dating but maybe you should consider an indian girl and youre like but were in america now i know but you should think about an indian girl i go no i mean you know if i meet one yeah but its not going to be my focus because theres so many other women around here i might as well try something else i mean if im going to get with an indian girl what was the fucking point of leaving in the first place at least over there we got way more choice but son– this is the bullshit they pull on them– son what will happen to our culture if we dont stay together what will happen to our culture let me tell you what will happen to our culture fucking nothing fucking nothing you know why because theres  billion motherfuckers right here  if every indian outside of india never married another indian again we would still have  billion right here you dont need us helping you even you guys are like stop fucking please we dont need any more heres what indian parents need to understand is that the indians and the chinese will forever always  of the time be on this planet no matter what theres too many of us to just go missing if there was a nuclear war tomorrow you know what would be left rats roaches indians and chinese thats all that would be left  and since everythings already made on this great continent of asia were going to be fine heres what indian parents need to understand if an indian guy has a kid with a white girl they have a beige baby thats a win for us i have two kids with latin women my kids are khaki if an indian guy has a kid with a black woman thats a brown baby with the possibility of a larger penis thats another fucking win for us  and if an indian guy and a chinese girl have a baby thats a super baby and thats a winwin and you can name the kid winwin  you know who i feel bad for in this world i feel bad for white people i do i feel bad for white people i know theres some in here but i cant see you youre back there i see you glowing in the dark i do feel bad for white people because youre dwindling at an alarming rate like theres not– you realize like in about  years theres not going to be any more purebred white people theyve just been infiltrated at all costs thats why i feel like i live in america and in america you see on the news you see white people have these rallies and people get really mad at them and i kind of sympathize with them you see them on the news like the white people need to be together with the white people they always add an h in front of it for some reason the white people and ill tell you what but theyre like white people need to be together with white people and im like yeah they do and theyre like what im like im with you we dont want you with us i know im not with you with you but i feel your pain what in the hells wrong with you boy im just saying well theres a lot of us and theres very few of you i just want to see the white people get preserved because if white people go missing who the fuck are we going to blame  im not ready for that kind of accountability look at scratch his kids are half indian yes he likes the brown and i dont mean–  but indian parents theyre– i know theres a lot of indian parents here too but you need to know indian parents that youre very good parents but youre also really shit parents at the exact same time heres why theyre good theyre good because they love you so much theyre shit because they love you so much because heres the problem with indian parents they love their kids to the point where they dont let their kids think at all like they dont– we dont want their brain to burn out just let us do all the thinking for you we will make all the decisions and it all stems from– we all keep– were missing a generation you realize that there is a generation missing from somewhere because our parents lived for their parents and our parents are trying to make us live for them and then i guess well pass it down and make our kids live for us and who the fuck is living themselves anymore but thats what they do they overpower you with the you know son just do what i tell you to do ok trust me on this dont do that go here dont go there talk to these people dont talk to those people and then im not the kind of guy th',\n",
       "  'at can ever just take information like that i always question everything so im like– if you want to see an indian parent fall apart question them holy shit they have no clue what to do my dad would be like son i dont want you going to that club tonight i go why not what do you mean why not i mean why not i need to know why i should not go to this club son because its a fact what what do you mean what does that even mean son it means its a fact you havent given me one fact son its a fact when something is a fact its a fact you cannot change a fact because a fact is a fact im like is that a fact i love coming back to india and ill tell you why because i love coming back to india you know whats funny is people ask me all the time whenever i come to india like russell why dont you like bollywood why dont you like bollywood ill be honest with you im going to tell you the truth right now heres the reason i– heres the real reason i dont enjoy bollywood films because i love car chases and you can never have a fucking car chase in mumbai  its not even a plausible idea quick get him  uncle   beat it were trying to have car chase uncle car chase went up to at least two kilometers an hour  heres the thing now and we live in a really interesting time where indians used to just always leave india to go on vacation im finding more and more indians are celebrating their country more theyre going to different places in india and having like these really nice trips and vacations and that to me is very important because the indians that left when we come here we only go to where were from we dont see anything else ever when i was a kid and i would come to india just bombay calcutta thats all i would see bombay calcutta bombay calcutta it got to the point where i didnt know if there was any more to india than just bombay and calcutta and i remember being here in bombay i was  years old and i said to my dad i go dad is there any more to india than just bombay and calcutta and my dad said no are you sure positive but there seems like theres a whole bunch of country out there im sure theres more people there are more people and they look just like you what do you want to see i was like dad can i see the taj mahal not from here physically impossible its a different place you know its one of those– its a beautiful place but i always try and explain it to people in north america that india is the kind of country where you could cut it in half and have a north and the south and probably create two countries– not that i want you to but im saying because theyre two completely different fucking worlds you take a guy from the north of india and a guy from the south of india and throw them in a room together they have nothing in common they cant speak the same language they dont look the same they dont eat the same food the only one common denominator throughout all of india is this thats the only one thing we can agree on you throw them in a room where are you from im from india im from india what part no not that part no growing up i was ripped off from the indian culture my parents didnt exposed me to it it was unfair because i hung around black people my whole life from the time i was about four years old all i hung around was black dudes and it wasnt until i was about  that i realized holy shit i dont know anything about indian people because my names russell my parents are eric and maureen my brothers clayton my grandparents are james christopher sheila eileen its not going to happen it wasnt till i was about  that i started to meet indian people and i was so excited to meet indian people but id never heard indian names i saw an indian guy and i go yo are you indian he goes yeah me too i go im russell he goes im pancag i go whoa what the fuck was that i go why do your parents not like you and then hes like– and this is when i realized how much i didnt know about indian culture– he goes hey you know that one indian song i go no i dont know what the fuck youre talking about because my dad was very much against indian music he didnt like the indian movies or the indian music at all it was just his– he just didnt like the sound of it and i get it you know like my mom would sneak the indian channel on every now and then and thered be like an indian song playing in the back ground my dad would just yell from the kitchen maureen shut that shit off sounds like cats in heat and then i remember hearing indian music for the first time and i go holy fuck it does sound like cats in heat  and thats why theres so many of us because we listen to horny cat music but when i say i didnt know anything about the indian culture i mean fucking basic things i was lacking and i was so mad at my parents for ripping me off from that part of my culture that i went out of my way to try and learn everything about indian culture but theres too much to know theres no way you can know everything about indian people thats probably why we believe in reincarnation so you can come back and finish the book but basic things like basic basic things i didnt know like we came to india about   years ago for shows heres how much i didnt know we got off the plane and the lady– all i can remember is my dad teaching me was son always be respectful ok always be respectful i go all right be respectful we got off the plane in bombay the lady greets us she goes namaste sir i go thank you my brother goes what the fuck was that i',\n",
       "  ' go im being respectful he goes no you fucking idiot youre supposed to namaste with her i go i dont know her like that i cant just start namasting bitches all over the place and catch a me too im not playing this game he goes no you fucking idiot you gotta bow and say namaste i go oh right namaste right so then we get to the hotel and the guy greets us he goes namaste uncle and i go uncle who the fuck is this guy we got cousins working at the hotel lets get an upgrade and then after a while i got the hang of it and i became like the namaste king you couldnt out namaste me for nothing i was like– i was namasting the shit out of people i was like namaste namaste namaste i was turning spins on it namaste motherfuckers i was like a black girl at church breaking it down namaste  there was a lady in my hotel lobby she was about to sneeze she went– and i went namaste she she went you fucked up my sneeze but i was on fire with my namastes everywhere and we were on tour and then my fake northern half of india is namaste namaste namaste namaste and then we went to chennai madras and id never been to the south before and we get off the plane and as we get off the plane the girl puts her hands together and i cut her off and i go namaste and she goes vanakkam  what what what whats that she goes vanakkam i said did you just say vanna come  i was like i like the south of course i want to come doesnt anybody want to come should you want to come at least once a day its different down there man its very different i try to explain to people the difference between north and south north taller lighter skin bigger features more body hair not that bright  its a fact you go to the south shorter darker smaller features less body hair much smarter and if you dont believe me that youre smarter in the south ill prove it to you all the computer shit that happens in the world happens in the south of india and i was trying to figure out why are they so good with computers and i figured it out its the languages because in the north they speak slower  then you go to the south and they sound like this–  and thats why they can read computer code   well there we are in madras and the promoter meets us at the airport and hes like hello russell and i go hi im russell he goes this is your driver and i go hey buddy im russell and he goes hello russell im naga lingam i said what happened he said i am naga lingam i said i dont know what youre saying that is my name sir what is your name naga lingam i said were going to need to work on this because i dont know that ill be able to say that please sir everyone just calls me naga i said oh i gotta be honest with you i grew up with black people and im a little uncomfortable with your name i got to be honest with you he goes

       "  'y girl friends is telling the difference between empowerment and entitlement its a fine line very easy to confuse those two like i have this one girl friend she thinks shes very empowered but shes actually just entitled and it comes out in the way that she complains that no man is good enough for her even though all she does is talk about astrology and go to music festivals she has no concept of what she deserves like she will go to a music festival for five days and do drugs the entire time and then shell come back and shell be like i told you theres just no good men out there no there are good men out there theyre just at home with their good women youre never going to meet them because theyre not at burning man watching you puke on your slutty native american indian costume we get in fights because she generalizes a lot about like all men and all women i know its weird that im criticizing that because generalizing about men and women did pay for my house but im evolving and i now find that really frustrating to engage with i had a guy come at me on social media he said well all women are just liars all women okay lets say some of these women are liars just for a thought experiment you have to admit the reaction of men lying and women lying in our culture is very different youve seen the movie catch me if you can great movie its about a con artist he pretends to be a doctor pretends to be a pilot so if youre a woman and you lie youre a monster if youre a man and you lie you get a movie made about you starring leonardo dicaprio what do we get we got fucking i tonya thats what we got you have to be in a leotard for anyone to give a shit i also did research on the guy that movie is based on he now works at the fbi they pay him millions of dollars to consult on other con artists so if youre a man and you lie thats like a hireable skill people dont like when women lie they get very uncomfortable when women lie thats my theory about why theres no female magicians never thought about that shit before because when men lie were like whoa magic if there was a female magician after every trick everyone in the audience would be like i fucking knew it what did i tell you i told you you cannot trust these bitches sneaky bitches the other generalization i keep hearing is well all these women are just golddiggers like okay fine lets say lets say some of these women are golddiggers you guys have to admit that you guys were afraid of golddiggers way before this even happened its hard for us to hear you guys complain about golddiggers because when you guys complain about golddiggers to us it kind of just sounds like youre bragging were like alright well a lot of the reason you have all that gold is because you have the advantage of being a guy especially in the goods and services industry a lot of the reason you have that money is because we buy a bunch of shit we dont fucking need so if im dating the head of sephora and i golddig him im not using him for his money im using him for my money that is my money im just trying to get that shit back um i feel like you golddigged me first bronzer should not be  when guys complain about golddiggers its tricky because to us the solution is so obvious if youre worried about golddiggers i have an idea how about just date women with their own fucking gold i dont know maybe stop dating  that need a kickstarter campaign just to eat dinner maybe just date adults with jobs i dont know i dont know no no no also its very ironic to me when guys complain about golddiggers because you know you were the original golddiggers right you know your greatgreatgrandfathers got a bunch of shovels and started digging up actual gold before women were allowed to leave the house i would love to dig for gold the oldfashioned way and get like a pickax and like a salad strainer and go get my own gold but you guys took it all and you refused to share so now were going to have to do this the hard way and be in a bad relationship for two years and hope that you cheat on me and i feel like i can say that because i have had a guy use me for my gold before and ive noticed when you hear the word golddigger you think of a woman right away men use women for their money too theyre not called golddiggers theyre called like backup dancers they have like a they have like a jaunty name its hard to talk about this stuff without sounding selfrighteous thats my nightmare im trying to not sound selfrighteous about all this because its my pet peeve when people are selfrighteous in conversations and i try to remember though that when someones self',\n",
       "  'righteous it usually just means they care so much about something that they become an asshole right i do it im guilty i am guilty i am very into animal advocacy and oh thank you oh thats very nice i dont have kids what else am i going to do there are times when i am so passionate about protecting an innocent animal that i will be a jerk to a human it happens kind of a lot and recently i saw a stray dog at this huge intersection in los angeles and nobody was stopping nobody was stopping so i pull over and i can see – that its a little tiny puppy – aww i know and i could tell it was in really bad shape okay so i get out of my car and this guy yells at me hes like you dumb bitch and i was like fuck you so im screaming at all these people i finally get like  lanes to stop and i get closer to this puppy and i get closer and closer to this little tiny puppy and i see that this little tiny puppy is a trash bag but i had already been such an asshole that there was really no turning back at this point so i just had to just had to lean in and thats how i got tetanus i am realizing that the guy friends of mine that are the most selfrighteous i actually think might be the ones that have done nothing wrong they assume these women must be exaggerating because they themselves would never behave the way theyre seeing in the news stories like you would never pull your dick out at work sir of course not of course not it would be ridiculous woo it would be crazy for you to do that that would be an insane thing to do but you have that one friend you can totally see doing that shit whats his name – jeffrey – jeffrey anyone that goes by jeffrey instead of jeff is a fucking asshole he likes to waste peoples time with his full name jeffrey thats who were talking about right i try to remind my guy friends were not attacking you were just you have to remember that the world is a little more dangerous for us because of the jeffreys of the world like you know we have to take a class to learn how to go outside right has anyone ever taken a selfdefense class before okay yeah thats a lot wow okay like  women the rest are dead okay i took a selfdefense class in my  and i think we could maybe update the tactics a little bit i remember the tactics she told me i physically cant even execute she was like if your attacker gets you on the ground gouge his eyes out what the fuck i cant even open a package from amazon without getting a paper cut i can hardly get a straw in a capri sun so im not sure this tactic is for me none of it was pragmatic she said to us never get in an elevator with a man bitch have you ever had a job have you ever seen an office building before its basically a bunch of elevators full of men if i didnt get in an elevator every time a man was in it id constantly look like i was trying to get into a double dutch game its fine just go you go okay ill just quit no we have to be able to get into elevators with men we have jobs now but i know thats a very sketchy thing to do and i know it could be dangerous so now when i get in an elevator with a man i just try to make myself as unattractive as possible so i just hit all the buttons so that were instantly in a longterm relationship and hes completely disgusted by me im like you want me youve got me for  more floors and i want to talk about the bachelor – huh – woo i used to carry mace i dont carry mace anymore because i find the packaging way too patronizing when you try to buy mace as a woman they sell you mace in a pink bottle im trying to look scary im trying to look menacing dont give me something that looks like a toy out of dora the explorers backpack mm swiper no swiping mm dont even think about it meh not really the vibe im going for a lot of my girl friends talk about how when they walk to their car they put a key in between their fingers yeah but they dont even make metal car keys anymore the new car keys are those little plastic remotes so thats a conspiracy think about that shit for a minute the one weapon we have has been taken from us so now ive got to use my mailbox key like an asshole a little shitty wolverine could you come forward a fucking inch a little shitty wolverine im just kind of tickling my attacker at this point just kind of delicately caressing him its kind of bringing him to climax at this point you look like a villain in an  movie just fyi its no joke out there its no i have a girl friend she carries a taser with her but google taser for women its even more insulting they try to sell you a taser that looks like a tube of lipstick its disguised as a tube of lipstick y',\n",

       "  'ts an insulting argument to women if anything they will replace blowup dolls which by the way i love that that was a product guys were fucking rafts with eyelashes and that wasnt freaking anybody out – this is where we draw the line – got it got it got it its so weird to me that everyones so fascinated about how bad the sex robots will be for women because you know theyre making male sex robots too right why arent you guys sweating if we get replaced by the female sex robots itll be a bummer but like well be fine what the fuck are you guys going to do if you get replaced by the male sex robots whos going to force you to go to the doctor youll all die of sinus infections you dont even know where the fricking forks are youll die i know there are some problems i know they need to make some tweaks to the robots i understand because ive seen them in person first of all theyre gorgeous this is a bad idea im a very jealous person i do not want a scarlett johanssonass looking robot in my house ill tell you this right now if they make the robots gorgeous there will be a war between human women and robot women and i swear to god we will freaking win i put barbie dolls in the microwave till i was  years old i live to destroy a doll i dont care about gadgets i dont respect technology ill kick alexa in the pussy i dont give a shit a robot tries to take my man were going to have a problem and ill be a savage about it too ill wait ill wait ill wait till you fall in love with her then ill kill her ill just push her in the pool i dont give a shit to me the solution for the robot anxiety is so obvious they just have to involve women in the designing of the robots thats it for us to embrace the sex robots they just have to benefit us in some way like if a robot is going to have sex with my man it also just has to be able to like make guacamole take an avocado you just put it in her mouth shes just like i dont know im not a scientist im just saying if theres a guacamole mode were going to get through this i am so confident in my stance on this i not only argue that sex robots are not going to replace human women i actually think theyre going to make you guys appreciate us even more heres why ive seen them they have hair what the fuck do you guys know about doing hair nothing youre going to get your robot day one its going to look like angelina jolie two weeks later its going to look like chucky then what then whats your big plan huh and youre going to call this guy baby will you come do my robots hair now i have to come brush its weirdass hair then im going to get emotionally attached to it because im taking care of it then im not going to let you have sex with it anymore now i just have a giant guacamole machine just another appliance i have to clean i know exactly how this is going to end its interesting that even the arguments i can see myself being the first to make against the robots i dont buy the big one i keep hearing is arent you worried the sex robots are going to make men objectify women no thats been happening for thousands of years i think if anything we can use the sex robots to combat the objectification of women what if we use the sex robots to help teach young boys consent think about it when you learn cpr you practice on a doll first anyone else think its kind of weird we give teenage boys human girls to practice sex on i feel like what we could start doing is when a kid turns  we give him his own sex robot he can do whatever he wants with it four years later he has to turn it back in to a committee who will evaluate the condition of the doll if its butthole is at all stretched out you go back to the beginning i was a little worried at first that being prosex robot might be an irresponsible take what if im condoning something weird what kind of people buy these things are they psychos perverts so i did want to do my research so what i did was i logged onto a forum secretly of the men that own the most current version of the sex robots and i monitored their conversations for two months thats the kind of time i have and look i thought they were going to be creeps psychopaths i dont know what to tell you theyre very lovely men theyre lovely they adore their dolls they marry their dolls that is happening i know it sounds crazy but it is now my dream in life to go to a sex robot wedding thats all i want mostly because im dying to see what a wedding would look like if it was solely planned by a man isnt anyone kind of curious the creative choices shes just going to come out in like a dolphins jersey like air jordans hes dragging her',\n",
       "  ' down the aisle like weekend at bernies like like who sits in the brides section is it the ups guy that delivered her i just i have a lot of questions after seeing these guys talk about how much they love their dolls and share information about taking care of them its really hard when someone wants to argue with me about it when someone says what if these men start treating human women the way they treat their dolls i got news for you they treat their dolls fucking great i actually argue these are the only men that know how hard it is to be a woman theyre on the message boards like can you believe mascaras  they get it we want this to catch on if guys start buying makeup the price will go down if guys start buying eye shadow its going to be like  at home depot so lets get this show on the fucking road this is what it has to come to i dont know i did a total  i thought they would be weirdos but now i tell you if i was single i would date a doll guy im going to say they have the skills i need they can do eyebrows they can do womens nails okay they can fully dress their doll while shes lying down thats what i need in a man a man who can fully change my clothes while im sleeping that is a timesaver alarm goes off out the fucking door in my crocs and miniskirt girlboss woo so interesting im on these boards and i did come across something that i do not condone some of the guys were trying to design and  print their own robot at home no no you guys cannot design your own female body that would be a disaster they would all just have like nine boobs across their chest the belly button would be a bottle opener their face would just be joe rogan its a bad idea its a copyright issue i did get final confirmation that the robots are not going to replace us in kind of a weird way so when guys order a robot they post photos online of the robot being built in the factory right these weirdass photos so im looking in the background trying to find clues and you know and i see that women are actually building the faces of the dolls interesting put a pin in that were going to circle back because then i saw a thread where guys were complaining about the struggles they were having in their doll relationships one of the threads was titled does anyone else struggle with when receiving oral from their doll her eyes pop out then i thought about the women making the dolls these bitches have our backs thats a very easy thing to fix theyre in the factories like you know what would be hilarious we should do it we have to do it lets just do it so once i found out there was a sex robot factory i obviously had to go heres why i went to the sex robot factory i am fascinated by the question is this impossible standard of beauty that women are killing themselves to try to achieve is that even what all men want i am delighted to report back that the answer is no not only did half of the dolls that were ordered have pubic hair the customers spend an extra  for it i spent  getting mine lasered off this is proof we are not communicating weve got to start talking to each other you guys it will save us money but that wasnt enough i still wanted to see what they were doing with the robot bodies what if they were making these impossible to achieve bodies that would be bad for society i especially wanted to see the boobs because in my head every guy wants the same kind of boob right giant dd a little tiny perky nipple no no theres a wall of nipples  different kinds one of the most popular oblong one of them looked like a piece of caramel fell on the floor best seller great news ladies whatever shape your nipple there is a man out there who will pay top dollar so i found this fascinating and i start talking to the guy who puts the nipples on the robots right it takes him  hours to put on one pair of nipples im like whats the problem mr potato head that shit pah pah lets go he said its actually a very meticulous process because they work very hard to make sure the nipples are uneven because for something to look human it has to have flaws if something is too symmetrical it actually looks creepy take that ryan goslings face that was great news for me and you guys might know why some of you might not know this but i had eating disorders until i was in my late  and as a result my boobs grew in different sizes thats a side effect for people who have eating disorders sometimes your boobs grow in a little bit differently i had to get three surgeries to get them straightened out one was bigger than the other one one was higher than the other one they they looked like from the sam',\n",
       "  'e general family one was just like a shittier version of the other one it was like alec baldwin and stephen baldwin i kind of just wanted two stephens you know or two alecs ill take either at this point and i was always so embarrassed about that before id get with a guy i felt like i had to explain what he was about to see id have to prepare him you know id be like do you like baseball and golf do you like young women and old men you dont have to choose big salvador dali fan so the tragic irony of this whole thing is that theyre still not even because one of the surgeons made a mistake and they cut through a muscle i know never get an operation by the airport a red flag i feel like i probably should have saw and i hated them for the last couple of years i hated them because i felt ashamed my whole thing is you know accept who you are love your body and i felt like a hypocrite because i had these implants in so i resented having all that work done for the longest time until a couple of years ago when i got in a really bad snowboarding accident and i broke my shoulder and i go into the surgeon and hes like i dont understand this injury makes no sense i see this all the time when people fall forward on a snowboard they break their nose they get a concussion you only broke your shoulder how did this happen and in that moment i realized that i bounced off my tits and that my fake tits saved my life so im having like a therapeutic moment at the sex robot factory ive been in  programs ive been in therapy for ten years im having the most emotional progress that ive had and im talking to this guy im like i dont understand why people are so against the robots what if we use the robots to make womens lives better what if every woman has her own robot clone think of all the things you can do with it to make your life safer before you walk to your car at night you can send it out ahead of you like a decoy you know how penguins push other penguins off cliffs you know like oh oh they got her okay im going to just take an uber i really think the sex robots would solve so many of our problems i keep reading about gray areas like mixed signals where two people have sex the next day the girl feels weird about it but the guy doesnt understand he thought she was into it you might not know this but sometimes we have sex with you before were ready because we feel guilty because weve been conditioned to believe that if we make out with you but dont have sex with you that your balls will like explode blue goo all over the ceiling and then youll be handicapped for the rest of your life youll never walk again so we feel bad and then we feel ooky the next day if we all have sex robots that whole dynamic goes away if you and i make out for  minutes but im not ready to have sex with you i can just say hey look i am not there yet but i do have a very flexible piece of tupperware in the other room it looks exactly like me without the ability to criticize you i think youre going to love it so im talking about this on stage for a couple of months and people want to come up to me and argue with me about this very hardcore this group of people came up to me and theyre like i cannot believe that youre condoning this what if people start to mistreat their robots i dont give a fuck how about that on my list of shit i have to worry about that doesnt break the top  things you know what i am worried about i am worried that as a species we are now more emotionally attached to machines than actual human beings have you ever seen someone drop their cell phone in water same person that when they see a starving child in a television commercial theyll be like what else is on but when there is a phone in water theyre like get the rice get the rice when you see the starving child thats when you should be like get the rice get the rice we give food to our phones so im talking to the guy that makes the robots im like i have thought through all these arguments i legitimately cannot think of a reason to be afraid of the robots and he said this is the real concern he said the real concern with the robots is theyre going to get so smart that theyre going to learn to override our commands i was like oh shit okay that sounds scary that sounds very scary then i was thinking about it more i was like wait we already have robots our phones are basically robots right and my biggest problem in life is that my phone actually does what i tell it to i need a phone that overrides my commands i need a phone thats like no bitch were not going to your exs instagram again today you broke up four',\n",
       "  ' years ago overruled no youre not buying those tiedye overall mini shorts youre too old for that shit reroute to chicoscom thats what i need so im talking to the guy that makes the robots and he was like you know do you want us to make a robot with your face on it and i was like ugh yes im actually in the market for an engagement gift for my fiancé so washington dc you are the first crowd to meet robot whitney so i dont know if she just looks really human or if ive just always looked like a robot but i would like you to say hello to this lovely audience hey hookers i had to do it i didnt expect this problem but its weirdly hard to name a robot that looks like you calling her robot whitney just sounds too narcissistic what should we call you lady please call me bear claw so i thought it would be hilarious to get this made and give it to my fiancé but he hates it hes like i dont like this its weird its creeping me out she just like stares at me all day im like oh really something staring at you making you uncomfortable now you know what its like to be a woman all the time you know that creepy feeling you have right now thats how we feel when you try to hug us at work same thing so i had to go out of town for a couple of days and i left my fiancé alone with her in the house then i came back i was like so how did it go with bear claw he was like i dont like her i dont like this thing but her boobs feel like boobs i was like did you fuck my robot i wish i had been a fly on the wall the moment he decided to touch her boob like he just walked by one day and was just like so the whole point of doing this was to explore the idea of can robots replace us right i have a lot of girl friends who i dont think would find a problem with that all my girl friends theyre expected to have fulltime jobs and do work at home every woman that i know says i need a double i need a clone look no further i would love for her to replace me i would love for her to get good at standup and tour all over the country so i can stay home and drink rosé all day so lets see lets see if she can replace me lets see if bear claw here can make you guys laugh alright bear claw tell us a joke why did the robot cross the road why to kill all the humans ha ha ha ha ha ha okay stop laughing thats not funny thats thats not shes not a good comedian youre laughing because its weird you are the one who programmed the joke whitney okay thats fair so i had this crazy epiphany when i was programming her to tell jokes for you guys where i learned a lot about my own programming because i realized when i tell her to say something she can just say it and i cant do that because im codependent im apologetic i cant say certain things because i feel bad i dont want to hurt someones feelings i dont want them to not like me but she doesnt have that problem because shes a sociopath so im going to start using her to say all the things that i cant say in conversations watch this no i do not want to hear about the dream you had last night you thought it was creepy now you kind of want one look what else she can say no i do not want to be your bridesmaid and my personal favorite i do not care about your gluten allergy i love you so much and i realized that women we are so conditioned to feel shame about asking for what we want right and we feel shame about being ambitious she doesnt have that programming look what else she can say i deserve a raise say it again for the people in the back i deserve a raise motherfucker too far thats too far thats called entitlement im going to start substituting her in to a lot of conversations that i cant handle especially in my relationship i do not do well in fights with my fiancé so im going to start subbing her in to say all the things that im incapable of saying watch this i am sorry i was wrong not possible for that to come out of my mouth so i truly did think this was going to be just like a funny thing where she would come out at the end and say a couple of things but i learned something else since ive had her in my house for the past month and i realized that i feel guilty putting her away which is bizarre like i tried to put her in the garage and i felt bad which i know its ridiculous i know shes just a bunch of wires and rods and shit but something about the face it it it feels human and so thats what weve got to watch because when i put her in the garage i started getting paranoid that she was like colluding with my lawn mower to destroy me so i now do understand the robot paranoia but i think as a species this is happening okay weve got to be rea',\n",
